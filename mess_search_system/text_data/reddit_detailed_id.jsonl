{"title": "Women don't care about male loneliness epidemic and that's okay ", "article": "Before I get to the point, I want to explain why I came to this opinion \n\nI recently watched a short on YouTube about a tiktoker who made a post \"IDGAF about male loneliness\". \n\nIt's a pretty condescending video where a woman made it about how women have it harder, how men need to grow thicker skin, how nobody cares about your feelings, how other men are the problem etc. Basically all the things that validates why men don't share their feelings with anyone (unironically also proving how it's not just other men who make fun of or weaponize men's emotions, the entire short was proof that some women do use men's emotions against them)\n\nShe basically goes into oppression olympics and says women have it harder but still persist and uses valid problems women experience to dismiss men's emotions all while having a smug look on her face. \n\nNow I explained the whole situation, let me elaborate my opinion formed. Watching some women's reaction to male loneliness epidemic, convinced me that women won't solve the male epidemic issue. \n\nBest solution to male loneliness epidemic is for men have deeper emotional connection with other men. The problem is men associate this deep emotional connection as gay or a sign of weakness. That should be removed. Men need to step up and actually take care of each other, men should be more emotionally supportive towards each other and be there for them when they need it. Have a more emotional brotherly bond, not shame your friends for being more feminine and such. \n\nBecause one thing I learned is that women are not good at solving men's problems because they simply don't understand it. They really don't get men's problems. So it shouldn't be their responsibility to help men solve men's problems. Before you say \"why should men care about women's problems then\" the thing is many men are just as dismissive as women, if not more dismissive sometimes. Women are taking care of their own issues, it's time men do the same for their own.\n\nBesides, do you really want a woman who is that dismissive and don't actually care to be involved with men's issues? \n\nYeah no, so I don't think women should be involved in this issue not should we expect them to be involved. Male loneliness epidemic is a problem that men should be able to handle themselves with the help of other men.", "id": 26, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1i2mi6s/women_dont_care_about_male_loneliness_epidemic/", "time": "2024-06-18"}

There is a fundamental difference between a US company driven by profits selling your data vs a country driven by National interest having your data. The enemy you know vs the enemy you don't.\n\n\"All social media can be used to spread misinformation\" Yes, but again, most of that is driven by profit or engagement, not national intent. Even when political parties are themselves the one who do it, why allow 3rd party country a foothold in the space to make a bad situation worse?\n\nLet's say, hypothetically, China were to invade Taiwan. And with a snap, suddenly TikTok is spewing not pro-China messaging, but anti-Taiwan messaging. Typically America first influencers are suddenly anti-America world power? They say it's not our problem, the US is to blame for the war somehow and that we owe nothing to Taiwan to begin with. These ideas will spread to the mainstream and you'll have Fox News host going to Beijing talk about how sweet China is in comparison to the crumbling US.\n\n\"Western propaganda\" some of you may say, I would like to note this is literally what Russia has been doing since 2016, and especially since the start of the Ukraine/Russia war. https://www.npr.org/2024/09/07/nx-s1-5101895/doj-says-russia-paid-right-wing-influencers-to-spread-russian-propaganda\n\n\nAlso keep in mind, India, the country that's in BRICS, the country that should be, on paper anyway, one of China's closest allies, has also banned Tiktok, maybe having your geopolitical rival a foothold in your social media space can lead to consequences down the line.....maybe such reasoning is why US apps are banned China outright.\n\nSecondly, \"Why are we focusing on X company and not Y company?\" A good number of people who ask this seems to be completely unaware the DOJ is literally doing this already.\n\nThe DOJ a few months ago, was able prove in a court of law, that Google is a monopoly and was using monopoly powers to crush competition. The DOJ is now recommending that Google should be broken up and lose chrome. Even if you think this won't happen, the very idea of Google being legally considered a monopoly is unprecedented in the field of tech, not since Microsoft during the late 90s has something like this come up. And as the following video I'm linking shows, all tech companies are being hit with anti-trust suits. So no, the government is focusing on all tech companies.https://youtu.be/jx2dDV2eWBM?feature=shared\n\nPersonally, 50/50 on if TikTok should stay or not.

If you're an American you certainly have privilege over someone born in Somalia. Absolutely.\n\nBut if someone says \"I achieved this by years of hard diligent work\" their work ethic and other virtues imbued by a good upbringing do not make them \"privileged\" in the way it is used today: \"You can't even see your privilege.

In that sense you have *a* privilege, but you are not \"privileged\" in the common parlance of today.

{"title": "East Asian education systems are basically slavery ", "article": "\\* **All the information that I will present in this post came from various sources on the internet. I have read many articles about education systems in China, South Korea, and Japan before. I made this post because I care about students, parents, and teachers in East Asia. I want students, parents and teachers in East Asia to have human rights just like their counterparts in North America and Europe. I have nothing against the people of any East Asian country. Disagree with me if you want because this is a free country after all.** \n\nEast Asian Education systems are well known for being rigorous, demanding and stressful on students in East Asian countries. Many people tend to claim that this is simply due to Asian culture which empasiseses academic success. I throughly disagree with this claim. Based off the information I have gathered from reading about East Asian education, I think that East Asian education systems are they way they are because designed to produce exploitable economic tools for either large companies or the government. East Asian education systems are designed without any regard for the individualized abilities and rights of students because they are designed to make everyone into assets of the same quality. \n\nHere are all the problems with East Asian education systems that make me think that they are basically slavery\n\n\\- No regard for mental disabilities like Dyslexia, ADHD or Autism\n\n\\- No regard for the fact that every person has inherent individual strengths and weaknesses\n\n\\- No regard for the fact that every persons has a style of learning that works best for them\n\n\\- Entirely based on memorization/route learning\n\n\\- No critical thinking\n\n\\- No problem solving\n\n\\- No creativity\n\n\\- Excessive emphasis on obedience\n\n\\- Making academics completive as if they where a sport or competition\n\n\\- Extremely stressful environment\n\n\\- Excessive workload\n\n\\- Lack of motivation for students\n\n\\- Not instilling confidence in students\n\n\\- Coercing students to only pursue specific white collar careers instead of allowing them to pursue any career they want \n\n\\- Teachers abusing students for poor academic performance which they have little to no control over\n\nIn my opinion education in East Asia is like the enslavement of Jews by the Nazis or the ensalvement of Africans in pre-civil war America. In all three of these instances massive numbers of people are forced to work extremely hard in deplorable conditions for people who are more powerful than them, who give them little in return for their work, and who abuse them when they do not meet there egotistical expectations. All three of these instances are based on the idea of only viewing people who do work as assets and nothing else. The only thing that determines the value of people who work under slavery is there ability to meet there masters expectations which the master takes for granted.  \n\nSouth Korea and Japans education systems are designed to produce exploitable economic tools for the Chaebols and Keiretsus respectively. Chinas education system is designed to produce exploitable tools for the various greedy and unethical companies which work under the Chinese Communist Parties model of authoritarian capitalism. Taiwans education system is a remnant of the Japanese colonial era and the military dictatorship which has yet to be replaced with a normal ethical education system. Each East Asian countries education system is the way it is for different reasons but that does not change the fact that they violate human rights. \n\nIt's not just students who suffer from East Asian education system. Teachers also work in excessively stressful and abusive conditions. Teachers are treated by there bosses the same way they treat there students. East Asian education systems are a tiered system of mistreatment with the people in charge of teachers on the top and the students on the bottom. Each level in the system abuses the level beneath it. Many East Asian parents tend to be demanding, abusive, and entitled regarding there children's academic performance because there child's academic performance is one of the very few things in there lives which they can control. In East Asian countries, teachers and parents also do not have human rights and they utilize their students academic performance as a way to distract themselves from the fact that they do not have human rights. In addition many East Asian teachers are also underpaid (due to the greed of there employers) which is another fact of there lives that they distract themselves from with their students academic performance. \n\nEast Asian education systems do not give students better lives because the workforce in East Asian countries is just as slavery like as there education systems. In China, South Korea and Japan people work extremely long hours with no-breaks and only have one day off each week. Even if these students succeed in their education and get employed by white collar employers, they will not be able to spend the money they earn on anything they want because they simply won't have the time. Also the extremely intensive studying for the college entrance exams in East Asian education systems also causes physical and mental health issues which impair working ability. East Asian education systems are systems where students are educated in a manner where they are slaves and the job they are being forced to do is to memorize enough information to meet there teachers expectations. East Asian students are basically people who are being educated to be slaves because the work that they will be forced to do as slaves requires extensive education . There are no other instances in human history where slaves needed to be educated to do the work that their master forces them to do. In this sense education in East Asia is a step above historical instances of slavery like the Nazi enslavement of Jews or the enslavement of Africans in pre-civil war America. \n\nNorth America and Europe have proven that technological and economic progress can be made without education systems that work like slavery. If East Asian education systems where good as there supporters claim them to be then America would not have landed and man on the moon and Europe would not have made all of its progress in clean energy. Raw academic knowledge on its own will not enable actual innovation. Actual sci-tech innovation also requires critical thinking, problem solving and creativity alongside academic knowledge. It's also much easier for students to gain academic knowledge in environments that are not excessively stressful or abusive. All of the sci-tech progress made by East Asian countries is despite not because of there slavery like education systems. \n\nI hope that criticism of East Asian education systems becomes more widespread and well known. The injustices permeated by these slavery like education systems needs to be exposed to not just the public in East Asian countries but also the world. Education should be a part of life where people feel interested, motivated and respected. Slavery is does not instill interest, motivation or respect in students or anyone else involved in education. All education systems across the world should strive to unlock the different potentials in each person in a manner that adheres to human rights.

", "article": "To start, I understand that love is love and people are going to do what they want anyways.. \n\nHowever, I believe that given the increased importance of height in society, if you are a tall man who wants to have kids one day it’s in your best interest to also date women that are relatively close to your height. \n\nFor better or for worse height is becoming more important in society, and being tall provides advantages for so many aspects of life. Most people are meeting online now a days where height is being filtered. Social media sites are filled with people demonizing short men/talking about height, with women very openly expressing their preferences online and referring to tall men as “prime real estate”. \n\nHowever, a lot of these women who only date men significantly taller than them, and value a big “height difference”, go on to have sons with these men that are at heights they wouldn’t have deemed viable. \n\nThe estimated adult height of a boy is calculated by averaging the height of the father and adding 5” to the mother. For example, if the father is 6” and the mother is 5”7, the adult height of the boy should be 6”. \n\nThis isn’t always the case and there are outliers, how ever this average is calculated for a reason as it usually ends up being correct. \n\nI know a guy that’s 6”4 who was boasting about how he slept with a bunch of women over the last few months, and was bragging about all his matches. When I told him to remember the advantages his height gave him when settling down, he got upset and said that height doesn’t matter. The reality is that most of those women would not have swiped right on him if it wasn’t for how tall he is. \n\nI work with a guy that’s pretty tall that takes a lot of pride in his height. Even insulting other male coworkers for being “short”, when his finance is 5” tall. If they have a son together he likely will grow up to be shorter then him. \n\nYou might think this is an awful way to see dating and I agree. But unfortunately with the way we’re moving backwards as a society, it’s in your best interest to act accordingly. \n\nThe fact is, many of these women are only dating/were initially interested in these men based on their height, so therefore I think from an evolutionary standpoint it’s foolish to compromise that advantage for your offspring. \n\nI’m average height in my country (5”10), and for every one couple I see in public where the man is my height or shorter, I see at least 3-4 couples where the man’s at or over 6 feet. I’m decently taller then 80% of the women in these relationships. I’m hesitant to date a women under 5”5, and mostly date women closer to my height or taller. \n\nDoes my dating “preferences” contradict me talking about the importance height? Perhaps. But I would argue I am the exception and not the rule. Should these women I date not be doing “charity work” for dating a man under 6 feet? Perhaps. But that’s their decision and not mine. \n\nI may come off as bitter, jealous and having a fragile male ego, but the reality is that this stems from my observations of society around me. \n\nIn conclusion, people can do what they want as mentioned initially, however I believe dating shorter women as a tall man is a bad idea overall if you plan on having kids one day.

{"title": "Anti victim blaming has gone too far", "article": "I used to think victim blaming just meant reducing the rapists moral/legal/social responsibility of the crime that they committed or lessening the victims victimhood status. I always have thought that is wrong and my opinion has not changed. But I learned recently that some consider much broader definitions, for example [link](https://www.sace.ca/learn/victim-blaming/) which includes this line: “It’s questioning people who experience violence — especially sexual violence — about their actions, and what they could have done to prevent it….” This extends victim blaming to analyzing violence to identify defenses and educating people on those defenses. Shaming this leads to more people getting assaulted. \n\nI also realize there is a time and place for this victim blaming. But this is an issue of unwanted advice which is usually simply rude and in the case of traumatic experiences is extremely insensitive. Telling a victim who wasn’t looking for advice what they could have done better in their personal situation is not acceptable. However, I recently found out that even a victim discussing what safety measures could be taken to try and educate others on safety is seen by some as victim blaming and is worthy of vitriolic personal attacks.\n\nMy opinion is that either the definition needs to be narrower, or we have to say victim blaming is a moral good when it comes to responsibly investigating and educating about safety measures. Telling others that if they want to be safe, they could take self defense classes, that they could make sure their doors are locked, that they could not be alone with people who have not earned a lot of trust is educating people on safety, not putting meaningful blame on the victim. Someone who does not do any of those steps does not deserves assault at all any more than someone who does all of them. But you can educate on safety without saying or implying that.\n\nSome of the counter arguments: \n\n1. People already know how to be safe: Any information about safety is either speculative or was learned by people looking at these violent acts and determining what worked and did not work. This fits under the broader definition of victim blaming. So no victim blaming means no building on or updating this information other than through speculation.\n\n2. We should tell potential offenders not to assault people instead as they are the morally responsible ones: Sure but this is a societal solution and you can simultaneously have a societal solution (political/cultural) that you advocate for politically and personal solution that you use to reduce your risk if you choose to. Not mutually exclusive with my view.\n\n3. Some victims did everything and still got assaulted: Safety is never guaranteed, it is about probabilities. I would never say that advocating to have a lock on your front door sucks because a bank had a full vault and someone still figured out how to crack that vault.\n\n4. The very discussion is traumatic to victims: And we have safe spaces for victims to heal, building on those seems like the correct solution to this problem. This does not mean the whole public discussion should be changed.", "id": 42, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1i2eff5/anti_victim_blaming_has_gone_too_far/", "time": "2024-11-06"}

Owe them anything. \n\nWhat this post IS saying: \n\nWhile women don’t owe men love, there are a lot of men out there would could be “saved” by a woman’s love. And the world would be a better place if more women looked at that as a positive thing instead of casting it aside immediately. \n\nThere are so many men out there who are legitimately great people and are so lonely they are literally deteriorating. I’ve been seeing it with my own eyes the past 10 years or so. Women won’t even look their way. And these are relatively attractive, well put together, kind men. \n\nResearch has shown us loneliness can harm people’s health both mentally AND physically. For as much as women don’t owe men their love or attention, I also know some of these good men do not deserve their health to be at risk from loneliness. I’ve seen men fall into deep depression, lose job opportunities, and fail to advance in life because (in my opinion) they don’t have the wind at their backs that is a supportive, loving partner.

I think Biden is the worst president in my lifetime, and honestly, despite all his flaws, I think Trump has many good characteristics that put him over Biden and definitely Kamala for me.\n\nFor four years, I have very much disliked Biden. I felt he was mentally inept, he wasn't true to his word, botched COVID, and, with the majority of my family in the military, they and I believe he really messed up the pullout. I didn't agree with many of his approaches across various policies and believe he just fueled the divide.\n\nThe last month or so, though, I finally feel a little better about him generally, and I think it's because he finally just gave the middle finger to the Democratic Party.\n\n* He got pushed out after winning the nomination, and I think they brought a lot of Republicans to a level of sympathy for him. Additionally, for four years, we felt it was almost terrible to have him out there given his mental state. When they pushed him out, it validated all those feelings, where I went from distaste to sympathy.\n* Throughout the election, he would undermine Kamala, and it was kind of refreshing to see him just be himself and say what he means instead of being a puppet.\n* He said recently he thinks he could have beaten Trump, which is like a \"F\\*ck you\" to the Dems.\n* He admitted he couldn't have served four more years because of his health, and there is something to the fact that he finally admitted, \"Yeah, I am old, and I don't have it; you are right.\"\n* Biden pardoned his son, which, even though I think it was wrong and means he just blatantly lied, also fueled Republicans' belief that the justice system is weaponized, so everything against Trump doesn't matter. But it also humanized him, as he did it because it is his son and he is a father.\n* Then yesterday was the one that made me really think Biden is alright: when the ceasefire happened in Israel, Biden went out of his way to say the peace was implemented and pulled off thanks to Trump's team. He obviously said his team was in negotiations, but he specifically said the peace deal was \"implemented by Trump.\" I respect that he gave credit to the incoming president, especially on such a major issue, and I KNOW the Dems DID NOT want him to say that, as it basically boosts Trump majorly as the peacemaker.", "id": 51, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1i2xbvs/biden_in_his_final_weeks_has_grown_on_me_some/", "time": "2024-12-26"}

I get that music is about the emotional impact, and for whatever reason his extremely boring compositions move some people more than say John Williams' music does, but I don't think anyone can say objectively \"He's a great composer\". If he's so great, why can't he write a single interesting composition that isn't just slow building string music with a bit of very simple piano riffs thrown in? Why can't he actually make a complex layered composition that isn't basically mood music? Nobody would listen to Lo-Fi music and talk about what musical geniuses the creators are, even if it's enjoyable.

{"title": "The Supreme Court is only political on one side", "article": "Everyone talks about how the Supreme Court is political, and how the conservative majority is enforcing their beliefs on society.\n\nOf course they will be politically connected, because politics are rooted in a person's view of reality, and a person's view of reality is rooted in their values and rationality, and values and rationality is how a person interprets the law.\n\nBy values, I don't mean necessarily what values they think the law should preserve and protect, but rather, their values about the idea of law itself. One side believes in process and order and principle and objectivity and [deontological ethics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/) more broadly, ie that the rightness of action is based on following good rules, rather than achieving good outcomes; while the other side believes in pragmatics and outcomes and 'for the greater good' and subjectivity and [consequentialist ethics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/) more broadly, ie that the rightness of action is based on the outcome, rather than by following universal rules. The thing is, the former is literally what law is in liberal countries like the US. The latter is the divinely-inspired king judging everything on a case-by-case basis and what 'feels' correct, with no concern about inconsistencies or predictable outcomes based on actions.\n\nI know everyone will say that the reversal of Roe v Wade was a political decision, but answer me this: why didn't they reinterpret the Constitution to grant fetuses personhood status, thus ensuring they have the same rights as newborns? I'm sure the 6 justices who voted to overturn Roe would all prefer a nationwide ban on abortion, or, at the very least, for abortion to be illegal everywhere (even if they aren't a fan of the federal government's involvement). And yet they didn't do that; all they did was overturn abortion as a Constitutionally protected *right*, allowing states to set their own laws about abortion.\n\nThe reason for that is obvious. Because Roe v Wade was bad law. It was bad law because it was a set of judges attempting to legislate what they think is good, rather than defining what the Constitution says. The Supreme Court's job is not to achieve good ends, except insofar as following the Constitution is a good end. If the Constitution enables or guarantees bad, it is the job of legislatures to write new laws (if the Constitution does not guarantee/prohibit something that legislators believe should be guaranteed/prohibited) or new constitutional amendments (if the Constitution guarantees/prohibits something that legislators believe should not be guaranteed/prohibited).\n\nIf you look at Supreme Court rulings, the so-called 'right wing' justices are much more likely to rule against their own personal beliefs of what the law *should* be and in favor of what the law *is*, while the left wing justices are almost guaranteed to interpret the law in the exact same way that they would choose to write the law if they were legislators.\n\nSo yes, the court is political, but only insofar as one half's political beliefs inhibit them from judicial activism, while the other half's political beliefs expressly encourage them to be legislate from the bench. A court of 9 right wing justices would not result in a right wing country, but a court of 9 left wing justices almost certainly would.", "id": 70, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1i2454h/the_supreme_court_is_only_political_on_one_side/", "time": "2024-10-25"}
{"title": "In the case of crimes, particularly DV and SA, police and DAs prefer to have less evidence, as more could lead an into believing there’s reasonable doubt. ", "article": "As we know, there are tons and tons of cases where people get convicted on testimony alone in the absence of any physical or circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is essentially evidence that the crime happened at all. And physical evidence includes circumstantial evidence but also evidence of the perpetrator (ie fingerprints or camera footage).\n\nTechnically, any crime can leave physical evidence and even more will leave some form of circumstantial evidence. However, cops don't want such evidence at all. \n\nSee here's the thing. Cops know that DAs,judges, and juries in the absence of a large amount of evidence will throw reasonable doubt out the window and instead just lean towards who they believe more. \n\nWith conflicting testimonies, people can't grasp reasonable doubt. They will end up voting for what they believe more. I think particularly in crimes involving victims, juries have a tough time with the reasonable doubt standard due to their emotions. They go to a default of believing the alleged victim and de facto it turns into a guilty until proven innocent scenario. \n\nAlso, it doesn't help that the alleged victim's testimony de facto carries much more weight compared to the accused, though there is absolutely no legal basis for this.\n\nWhen physical evidence gets involved, now, people are able to be more objective with it. People are more open to the idea that a specific piece of physical evidence does not lead to the accused than they are that the alleged victim's testimony is false. \n\nPeople are likely to think more critically and uphold the standard of reasonable doubt, when they have circumstantial and/or physical evidence alongside testimony than they would just with testimony alone. \n\nSo, DAs and prosecutors wouldn't exactly want any evidence outside of testimony at all.

But its not entirely his fault.", "article": "In the new 'Mufasa' movie, a prequel to 'The Lion King' live action remake, we learn the backstory of Mufasa and Taka (Scar).\n\nIn this movie we learn that Taka is the prince (and future king) of a small pride of lions. He rescues a young Mufasa who was separated from his pride by a flood.\n\nWe learn that Taka's pride is massacred by a group of outsider lions, Mufasa is tasked with protecting Taka until he can build a pride of his own.\n\nThroughout the movie, Taka saves Mufasa's life multiple times.\n\nDuring this journey, the two young males also meet Sarabi, a princess of a neighbouring pride (who eventually becomes Mufasa's mate and they have Simba).\n\nThere is no exact point at which Taka becomes a villain. It is a rhetoric that is ingrained in him since he was born. His father coaxes his entitlement.\n\n**Obasi, Taka's father, does not allow Taka to associate with the females of the pride. He claims that Taka is too good to hunt with the females, that he is the future of the pride and his bloodline must be protected. He instils an understanding that Taka is entitled to rule. (Mufasa, and outcast, is allowed to hunt with the females and thus fosters a better understanding of the struggles of the females of the pride).\n\nSo, when Sarabi is introduced, Taka falls in love, and his entitlement (fueled by his father's teachings) for a relationship with Sarabi grows. To the point where he convinces Mufasa to lie about who saved Sarabi during a stampede to make himself look better (among other things like recognising the scent of flowers on her coat).\n\nMufasa, being loyal to his brother, obeys. And it wasn't until Sarabi confronted him with evidence that he told the truth.\n\nMufasa, having had experience with interacting with female lions since his youth, is more comfortable speaking with Sarabi and they bond more quickly. Taka is not so lucky, as his father's commands meant he was unable to develop any meaningful communication skills with the females of his pride, he struggles to bond with Sarabi.\n\n**Still, Taka feels entitled to Sarabi because of his understanding that his destiny is to be king, and kings choose their mates. But, what Takas father failed to teach him is that a King without a pride is nothing, no other pride will recognise a solitary male as a king. So for a king to come from nothing, he must earn it.\n\nNow, whilst Taka does save Mufasa multiple times, he also repeatably shows himself as a coward.\n\nMufasa, on the other hand, repeatably defends others and shows little cowardace.\n\n(Many people site that Taka saved Mufasa multiple times and whilst there were few incidences where Mufasa protected Taka, there were many demonstrations of Mufasa protecting other lions such as Sarabi and Taka's mother, despite terrible odds)\n\nWhen Sarabi declared her love for Mufasa and her disinterest in Taka, Taka takes this as the last straw of \"things he's lost\" (despite Sarabi never being his to claim) and betrayed Mufasa by leading the lions that massacred his own family to Mufasa so they could have revenge on him for killing the prince of their pride (who Mufasa killed in defense of Taka's mother - Taka fled this fight instead of helping his mother and adopted brother, he didn't even go to get help, he just ran away).\n\nAlthough Taka ultimately changes his mind and saves Mufasa again, he still goes on to spend the rest of his life plotting to reclaim the throne (and Sarabi in turn).\n\n**TL;TR:\nTakas entitlement, fueled by Obasi's teachings, is what ultimately led Taka to villainhood.\n\nAnd that's not inherently Taka's fault. That's Obasi's fault for raising Taka under the assumption that he would always have the witness of the rest of the pride to speak for his claim to royalty.\n\nObasi never thought to raise his child to prepare for a world where he does not have the privilege of family to back up his claim to a throne.\n\nNot only this, but Obasi instils that Taka is somehow more entitled to becoming a king than the royalty of any other neighbouring pride displaced by the outsiders that killed Obasi's pride.", "id": 86, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1i27opv/yes_taka_is_a_villain_but_its_not_entirely_his/", "time": "2025-03-11"}

{"title": "The general discourse around echo chambers on social media is wrong ", "article": "Kind of a meta post given that the \"Reddit is a liberal echo chamber\" is a monthly recurence on here. \n\nI wanna tackle two points in this post: \n\nThe first one is that the echo chamber effect on social media is vastly over-estimated. The review of academic works and empirical data on that matter only allow us to say that the likelyness of a social media user to be ideologically isolated in an echo chamber depends mostly on the user's media consumtion practices and the plateforms they use. \n\n\"There are a number of areas where our review suggests that there is a clear \nmajority view in academic research, including most notably: \n\n● Politically partisan online news echo chambers are generally small – much smaller than is often assumed in public and policy debate. \n\n● Automated serendipity and incidental exposure mean that relying on search engines, social media, and other digital platforms using algorithmic ranking leads people to slightly more diverse news – the opposite of what the filter bubble hypothesis posits. \n\n● Self-selection, both along partisan lines and, importantly, in terms of levels of interest, plays a significant role in shaping news and media use. \n\n● There is no single uniform trend towards greater polarisation – ideological polarisation has declined in some countries, affective polarisation has increased, news audience polarisation varies greatly, and in every case, country-specific factors seem decisive, not a single global trend like the rise of the internet. \n\n● Elite cues continue to play an important role in shaping both news coverage And public opinion, with the behaviour of political parties and individual prominent politicians often contributing to polarisation, whether around Ideological issues or science issues such as climate change. \n\nGiven the amount of research on these issues arriving at broadly similar conclusions, the burden of proof now, in our view, is on those arguing for \nalternative interpretations to provide systematic evidence. \"\n\nhttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6e357e97-7b16-450a-a827-a92c93729a08\n\nThe second point I wanna tackle is the idea that Reddit is a worse plateform than twitter or others social media because it's a bigger echo chamber. \n\nAccording to this study it's quite the opposite, information diffusion is less biaised on Reddit than it is on twitter or facebook. \n\n\"These results indicate that information diffusion is biased toward individuals who share a similar leaning in some social media, namely Twitter and Facebook. In contrast, in others—Reddit and Gab in our analysis—this effect is absent.\" \n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2023301118\n\nSo next time you wanna bring the argument that social media plateforms are glorifiee echo chambers and Reddit is that big scary leftwing echo chamber, you will know that your opinion does not reflect state of the art in communication sciences and sociology of the media. \n", "id": 92, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1i229ww/the_general_discourse_around_echo_chambers_on/", "time": "2024-11-03"}

As to business practice on how much you pay your employees, that is different between owners and philosophies.\n\nI believe in paying your workers their fair wage, taking care of their families and giving benefits where needed and where you can. However a fair wage is relative. I would go as far as to say that the majority of Americans have a spending problem, and that’s not to say we don’t hav economical issues like wages stagnant and everything else is inflated, but that for people with money problems, they will have money problems regardless of how much money you give them because they only spend their money on liabilities and not assets.\n\nThe only entitled people are workers who think that every business they work for, owes them everything. But these kind of people are the people I’d never hire because the entitlement can’t be fixed. Everything is someone else’s problem and never theirs, they only cause problems in their own world and in other people’s worlds. No amount of compensation would make them happy other than a 6 figure salary for little to no work at all.\n\nI agree, the world is going to shits, the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer everywhere you look.

{"title": "I hate it when people simplify complex ideas and think they’re smart for it. It’s the opposite.", "article": "Context: It’s when an idea is nuanced, yet people act like you’re overcomplicating things when all you’re doing is showing that it’s not so simple. You explain your reasoning thoroughly, but they ignore everything you’ve said and respond with something like, \"Just bla bla bla, simple. No need to overcomplicate. \". \n\nHere is a concrete example:\n\n**Me:** \"If we’re talking about sugar in the context of health, there are two categories of sugar to be aware of: simple sugars and complex sugars. You shouldn’t consume more than 36g of simple sugar in a day, but for complex sugars, it’s okay to eat more, as long as you’re mindful of the calories. Simple sugars are found in beverages, processed foods, etc., while complex sugars are found in fruits, rice, and similar foods. However, fruit juice should be counted as simple sugar because it’s just as damaging. In fact, we don’t need simple sugar at all.\"\n\n**The Typical:** \"Why can’t you just say sugar is bad? Simple and easy to understand.\"\n\nThen, they proceed to stop eating all kinds of sugar, rice, corn, pasta—anything with carbohydrates—and later blame \"science\" for making them sick. In reality, they are the ones who oversimplified the information, misunderstood it, and hurt themselves because of it.\n\nNext, they do a 180 flip. Since \"science\" supposedly hurt them, they turn to their like-minded peers to echo the sentiment that \"science is bad.\" Now, they go to the opposite extreme: eating all kinds of sugar without moderation. Over time, they gain additional weight and develop long-term health issues from consuming too much simple sugar.\n\nThe reality is, some concepts simply can’t be simplified without losing crucial details. It’s not complicated by choice—it’s complicated by necessity. Most things in life are not that simple.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Another Example:**  \n**Me:** \"The news is very biased. If you only listen to one side, it can brainwash you into siding with them.\"  \n**Context:** I’m talking to someone who ONLY watches Chinese media and believes China is the leader in space travel.  I'm not against China, but this is simply not true.\n\n**Them:** \"But this is international news—it’s available to everyone. They can’t lie, or there would be consequences. Everyone can see it. They wouldn’t lie.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Outright lying isn’t the only way they can manipulate you. There are many ways. For instance, they can only report their successes while showing only the failures of others. This creates the illusion that their side is winning, even though the reality could be the opposite. For example, if China highlights two of its successful launches but hides ten failures, while only reporting two U.S. failures and ignoring ten U.S. successes, you’re going to think China is ahead. But in reality, it’s just cherry-picking data. No one holds them accountable for this because they technically didn’t lie. They just omitted information to create a narrative. You can’t sue a media outlet for omitting details. And even if someone calls them out for it, you wouldn’t know, because you only get information from them.\"\n\n**Them:** They refuse to comprehend and keep repeating: \"But it’s international news. Everyone can see it. If they do anything bad, there would be consequences. They wouldn’t do that.\"\n\n**Me:** In disbelief, I try another example: \"Another way they could manipulate is by presenting allegations as if they were convictions. For instance, anyone could falsely accuse you of rape—\"\n\n**Them:** They cut me off. \"DON’T say someone might sue me for that. It’s negative! Blah blah blah.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Okay, let’s say it’s John. If someone hates John, they could arrange for a false accusation of rape. The media could title it, 'John Alleged to Have Sexually Abused a College Student.' Most people don’t care about 'innocent until proven guilty.' They’ll assume it’s true just from the headline. The majority of the population actually behave this way. Just look at Johny Dep; you're probably one as well.\n\n**Them:** \"Nah, they wouldn’t do that.\"\n\n**Me:** got mad, and start explaining it in obvious way.  \nThem: \"Why can't you just simply say the news outlet is fake\".  \nMe: BUT IT's NOT FAKE, OMG.   \n  \nThey simplify \"News can manipulate you\" into two extremes:\n\n1. \"News won’t lie because there’s accountability.\"\n2. \"News is fake, so never trust any news.\"\n\nReality is far more nuanced. The media often uses omission, selective reporting, and framing to manipulate narratives without technically lying. This isn’t \"complicating\" the issue—it’s acknowledging how manipulation works in practice. And the solution isn't to completely trust the news or completely ignore the news. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nAnother:  \n**Them:** \"Complicated math is useless outside of school.\"  \n**Me:** \"It depends on what you do! If you’re flipping burgers, playing sports, working as a lawyer, or in some subsets of business and other professions, then yes, it’s useless because you’re not going to use it. But for those interested in fields like engineering, computer science, and similar areas, this math isn’t anywhere near useless—it’s foundational. The same people who claim math is useless are never the ones designing airplanes, creating games, building bridges blueprints, or tackling complex engineering marvels.\"\n\n**Them:** \"But I’ve never had to use it, and I’m still doing fine.\"  \n**Me:** \"I know, and that’s because you’re not interested in a field that requires it. But you’re assuming that everyone’s goal is just to be 'doing fine.' What about people who are passionate about fields that depend on advanced math and want to work in those areas? If they take your advice, they’re screwed.\"\n\nThem: \"Well, just don't do those job, only money matter anyway, simple and easy to understand\".  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThere’s so much more I could say, but the point is that when you simplify something, you’re inevitably dropping important details. That’s literally the only way to simplify.\n\nAnd don’t hit me with the quote, *\"If you can’t explain it to a 5-year-old, you don’t really understand it.\"* That’s complete nonsense. You absolutely can’t explain something like general relativity to a 5-year-old without skipping 90% of the details that make it functional.\n\nIf you think you understand general relativity, try simplifying it for a 5-year-old. You’ll quickly realize that what you’re presenting isn’t the real thing—it’s a dumbed-down version. People often mistake understanding a simplified version for understanding the actual concept. But knowing a watered-down explanation is not the same as truly understanding the full complexity.\n\nNow, as for the title, Simplifying complex ideas is not smart, it's the opposite. \n\nI said that because people often mistake the ability to simplify as something \"smart.\" It’s not. Simplifying is the easy part—you just omit all the details, and things become simple. That’s how most people do it, and they get praised for it. But it’s easy to do that.\n\nWhat’s hard is actually tackling the problem head-on and being willing to dig through all the nuance. That’s the smart part—being critical and thoughtful rather than a simpleton. Simplifying is easy because all you’re doing is omitting details.\n\nFor example:\n\n* It's much easier to say \"Don't eat sugar\" or \"It's okay to eat sugar\" rather than explain that there are different kind of sugar. \n* It's much easier to say \"The news is fake\" or \"The news is not fake\" rather than to explain how news can manipulate you and how you can resist it. \n* It's much easier to say \"Math is useless\" or \"Math is useful\" rather than explaining how it's subjective to individual. \n* It’s much easier to say, \"John stole because he’s a bad person,\" than to say, \"John stole. His action is wrong, but there might be a reason for it—maybe he was desperate. This doesn’t justify it, but understanding the reasoning helps.\"\n* It’s much easier to say, \"Women and men are the same,\" than to say, \"There are areas where women are better than men and areas where men are better than women. We are generally different, but we all deserve the same rights, opportunities, and treatment.\"\n* It’s much easier to say, \"You hate Black people, so you’re racist,\" than to say, \"You’re not racist. You hate John because he stole from you, and he happens to be Black. It’s not about his skin color; it’s about his actions. You would hate anyone who did that, regardless of race.\"\n\nAs you can see, simplifying things is easy. It’s not a \"smart\" skill—it’s the opposite, because it involves omitting important details. When people choose not to simplify something, it’s not because they can’t; it’s because they value accurate information and don’t want to leave out essential details. You inability to comprehend complex idea, doesn't mean your \"simplify\" everything trait is smart.

A subsidy is when the government gives the tax payer's money to a business (in this case, animal farmers) to prop it up.\n\nThese subsidies could instead finance cheap and healthy foods. For example, bananas, peanut butter, bread, rice and beans could become even cheaper with subsidies. This would help low income families afford food, because things like bananas would cost next to nothing (they are already pretty cheap). This would also reduce the need for programs like food stamps, because even if you make minimum wage, 5 cents bananas are not expensive. We would end up in a situation without food insecurity and without government bureaucracy to waste money on who gets benefits and who does not.\n\nIn addition, many people have ethical problems with the meat industry. Climate conscious people often try to limit their meat consumption, yet they are forced to use their money to increase emissions. Vegetarians who abstain from meat due to ethical concerns about animal rights (myself included) are also included in this group. Think about an industry that you find morally disgusting.

But it started getting old and tired by the time of the Beauty and the Beast one, and as we started to come up on Aladdin and the Lion King, it starts to become clear to most of us what's wrong with it (other than it just being a cynical, systematic cash grab).\n\nThese movies weren't *made* to be serious-looking, live-action dramas.  It turns out, there are elements to facial expressions that can appear on cartoon Simba's face that you can't put on an actual lion and still get it to look real.  There is physical comedy that lends itself well to 2D hand drawn animation that doesn't translate well to real-and-gritty.  \n\nThere's nothing wrong with realism as an art choice - but the movies they're mindlessly dunking in it weren't designed with realism in mind.  It ruins most movies for the sake of the reboot gimmick.\n\nAnd that extends well beyond Disney reboots and art styles.  This applies to almost every nostalgia cash grab in media, trying to put complex, rich, deep concepts meant to appeal to adult minds into franchises made for dumb fun or for kids.\n\nBecause here's the thing: interesting, complex, well-written media with good worldbuilding and thoughtful real world applications exist, all over the place - things that don't HAVE to have some silly character or setting shoehorned into them for the sake of nostalgia.\n\nWant good worldbuilding?  Read Game of Thrones.  Don't try to slop a bunch of history, geography, and complexity into Special Wizard Boy Finds The Magic Trinket.\n\nWant a complex real-world exploration of a near-future, space-travelling humanity?

Watch House of Cards, instead of trying to put character complexity, motives, schemes and politics into Hero Man versus Doctor Dastardly.\n\nHave real adult interests?  Watch/read literature and media designed for actual adults with an interest in complexity.

{"title": "The \"TikTok refugees on Xiaohongshu / RedNote\" narrative being pushed on both platforms and MSM right now is massively overhyped", "article": "So I'm Chinese American, I've been able to read Chinese since I was 3, and I began using RedNote (Xiaohongshu) a whole year ago. And I have to say, RedNote makes for a pretty unusual option for a TikTok substitute.\n\n- The user experience is much closer to something like Instagram than TikTok: you scroll down a whole menu of posts, the posts don't take up the entire screen, and the nature of the content aligns more closely with what you'd find on Instagram or Pinterest than on either TikTok or China's version of TikTok (Douyin).\n\n- There are other apps out there like Meta's Instagram Reels or Google's YouTube Shorts that provide the same (or better) functionality and even content, but aren't owned by China and therefore avoid the same security concerns (however valid you believe they are) as ByteDance. Like, why promote another Chinese app as the de facto \"canonical\" TikTok clone if there's a very good chance that either a)  the US government uses the same legislation to ban it in turn too, or b) the Chinese government decides to segregate the app into a walled-off ID-required version for their own citizens, and a more \"open\" one for foreigners... which is exactly how Douyin and TikTok respectively have operated?\n\n- No offense, but the design of RedNote is absolutely horrid compared to any of the others. A lot of the features aren't even functional, you're forced to select from a tiny predetermined music library, and hashtags are so buggy when trying to input English (Latin)-alphabet tags that for a while I didn't even know using them was possible. Furthermore, almost all the information is in Chinese, and I'd wager only a small fraction of TikTok's userbase speaks or understands that language (though it's great that people are trying to learn!)\n\n- Many (albeit not all) of the recent \"hi, I am a TikTok refugee from the US\" posts on RedNote are written in far inferior English than what I'd typically expect from Americans who use TikTok. I did a little scrutinization to see if any of the ones I saw were Chinese users mocking Americans, while unlike (non-Chinese) TikTok and Instagram but standard for Chinese social media, users are automatically marked with their country of residence (or province if in China), most of the posts in question do indeed indicate US provenance, but then again, location should be fairly easy to spoof if you've got an agenda on your hands. (They're also often fairly basic in quality, especially compared to TikToks, but that could be chalked to the aforementioned limitations of the platform's editor.)\n\nThere are so many confusing questions, and to me, a lot of this just simply doesn't add up. What I think could be happening is that the TikTokers jumping ship to RedNote represent only a specific subset of users whose parents, relatives, or close (IRL) friends might use RedNote out of familiarity with the platform and the Chinese language, and it's catching on to the general TikTok userbase in much smaller proportions than all those news articles are ready to admit (with most of the \"normies\" just heading over to YouTube Shorts or Instagram Reels, if they weren't there already).\n\nI'm also willing to consider the possibility that it's some government that could be behind this, but I'm just not sure which. If it's the US government, then why would they make a big fuss over one Chinese app only to prop up another? And if it's the PRC (or Russian, etc.) government, then why would they be so keen on letting foreign TikTokers - their own \"brainwashing\" victims, if you believe this, though I don't, which is another story - roam free on what generally tend to be walled-off spaces on the Chinese internet?", "id": 108, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1i1k1xg/the_tiktok_refugees_on_xiaohongshu_rednote/", "time": "2024-06-30"}

Apparently, it could potentially be months before we get a verdict, despite the fact that the ban is going to go into effect on SUNDAY, AKA 4 DAYS FROM NOW! In my opinion, this is completely unacceptable. Even this ban truly is unconstitutional, then the supreme court should immediately pounce on the ban. But no, they're taking their sweetass time.\n\nOver the course of this week, Congress has considered extending the deadline to 270 days.

We are all simply taking other substances. Adderall, SSRIs, Benzos, and Marijuana just to name a few, are some of the wide variety of substances younger people take regularly at much higher rates than older generations. While I understand many people take those medications as part of a prescription from a real doctor, they are still psychoactive substances, often time regulated and controlled by the DEA much higher than alcohol is.\n\n If these substances,  especially recreational ones, weren't available alcohol would be much more popular amongst the younger cohorts. \n\nPart of the reason these people don't drink as much is because alcohol ruins the effects of those substances.

The median income in the US is around 4.8 per month in USD. Not even accounting for the currency difference, we literally make half the income of an American.

That's  7% of our monthly salary versus 1% of yours.\n\nLike let me ask, if there was ANYWHERE in the world who is capable of not buying fast fashion, wouldn't it be in America? Those Temu prices are affordable to us but pennies to Americans. If clothes are considered expensive in America, then who else can buy sustainable? It's definitely not us.

Despite not using the app, as a libertarian I find it hard to justify banning something that only harms those whom choose use it. Although I still find it somewhat ironic that the left suddenly hails TikTok as a bastion of free-speech, despite probably ranking in dead last for free speech in my opinion. They literally auto moderate posts that include anything regarding Tiananmen square, Chinese mistreatment of Uyghur Muslims and other general anti-CCP rhetoric. I think much of it has to do with the anti-Trump, pro-Palestine stance much of TikTok has adopted. However, I feel that's just the CCP indirectly projecting its own geopolitical interests upon western citizens. Yet somehow vast amounts of leftist's support banning/regulating sites like X and 4chan on the basis of “hate speech”.  \n\nThe double standard is hilarious when the left supported Brazil banning X; then later became outraged after the US considered a TikTok ban. I think the root cause of the issue is leftists wanting echo-chambers. The idea of migrating to a site like X after a TikTok ban and having to deal with someone whom may have a different opinion simply infuriates them. It somewhat stems from TikTok being a very politically-sheltered platform when it comes to leftists not having to deal with conservative/alt-right opinions.

Basically everyone I know, even a handful of religious conservatives, do not care if a gay couple wants to get married.\n\nWhy? Because the anti-gay marriage stance is morally/logically indefensible. There are no 'real' arguments agaist gay marriage. They all depend on religious dogma or irrational homophobia.\n\nMost issues, even ones that I feel strongly toward one side about, **have** real arguments on the contrary side. Take gun control, I am very strongly pro-gun. I will concede that there **are** 'real' arguments on the anti-gun side. Yes, they do believe that banning guns will help keep them out of the hands of criminals, or reduce the risk of accidental gun deaths. Or at least that is the intention anyway. I do not find them **good** arguments, because I disagree with them, but they still have *some* debatable merit to them. I believe the right to self-defense, and not restricting law abiding citizens because of the acts of deranged criminals, are **stronger** arguments. So I take the pro-gun stance, even though, I admit, there are morally defensible arguments for the anti-gun side, albeit questionable.\n\nBut anti-gay marriage got **nothing!** Nada!

{"title": "Computer Science is the worst major you could choose.", "article": "Hey everyone, I just wanted to share an opinion on college majors and career paths. **Don’t major in Computer Science.** After you graduate with a computer science degree, it can be nearly impossible to get a job. This is because the field is oversaturated. Everyone and their grandparent is trying to get a job in computer science because of one thing: \"MONEY.\" . I majored in English, and I don’t regret it. I am in debt, but the reality is that I’m probably never going to pay it off in my lifetime. Who cares right? I went to college for the experience and to improve my writing skills.\n\nI believe an English major is better than a computer science major for three reasons:\n\n1. English teaches you communication skills and helps you become better at arguments.\n2. Language and Liberal Arts degrees are typically easier, less stressful, and less competitive than STEM degrees.\n3. Finally, the ROI (Return on Investment) isn’t very good these days.\n\nCommunication is very important, both on a casual and a professional level. You’d be surprised how many new grads in Gen Z have poor communication skills. If you read a job application, almost all of them require excellent verbal and written communication skills. These are skills that can be developed through public speaking and liberal arts classes. You might argue that English is a universal language, which is true, but you would be surprised by how many immigrants and people who come to the U.S. don’t speak English well. Developing strong communication skills can set you apart from other applicants.\n\nThere are current trends and studies suggesting that Gen Z is reading below grade level. Back in the 70s and 60s, 70% of children were reading books; now, that number has dwindled down to about 15%. This shift is due to kids spending too much time on electronics, and it will have a major impact on the workforce.\n\nI get it—difficulty is subjective. What I find difficult, you might not, and vice versa. There are many studies showing that many STEM degrees have a higher dropout rate compared to liberal arts majors. Also, grades in STEM fields are often curved, which means they depend on how the entire class does. Curving grades can create an unhealthy competitive environment, which isn’t ideal. I know that some non-STEM areas of study also have curved grades, but it’s much more common in STEM fields.\n\nROI is important when choosing a college major, and in my opinion, STEM degrees generally have a poor ROI. I know someone who happens to be my brother’s older cousin’s friend. He graduated from MIT with a computer science degree. He paid about $80K a year for his degree, had a few scholarships, but after graduating, he found himself $270K in debt. That’s not ideal. He will likely never pay it off unless he wins the lottery. The same can be true for most computer science degrees—even if you go to a state school, you could end up with over $80K in debt if you're not careful.\n\nJust a bonus reason for you folks: English and language arts majors have more job opportunities. You could become a teacher or a writer, which can earn a good amount of money. The chances of becoming the next J.K. Rowling are higher than you might think, if you consider the statistics and perform the calculations. Most importantly, an English degree can set you up for law school.\n\nFinal verdict: Stay away from computer science. It’s too hard, and it won’t help you “get women” in college or in real life. You’ll probably end up depressed in your dorm room, smoking weed and possibly even resorting to harder substances trying to finish projects. Most importantly, college isn’t just about getting a job—it’s about getting an education. There's a difference, folks. At the end of my English class, we watched a movie. How cool is that? In computer science, they just give you boring tests.\n\nI’ve noticed that many computer science majors can be rude, and they often think they’re better than others. But in reality, most of them are pretty dumb and lame.\n\nTLDR; Major in liberal arts not computer science", "id": 173, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1i0on58/computer_science_is_the_worst_major_you_could/", "time": "2025-01-04"}

No one knows exactly when or where, but it is certain that California will experience more wildfires and Florida will experience more hurricanes, especially as global warming exacerbates these climatic consequences. Considering this, states and localities should bear the burden of planning for and repairing the damage from these circumstances.\n\nIt is fundamentally unfair that people who live in more safe and sustainable regions of the country must subsidize the dangerous development patterns of those who choose to live in disaster-prone areas. It is also short-sighted because it incentivizes less resilient settlement patterns, meaning more people are harmed and displaced by disasters in the future. Many people affected by recent disasters likely wouldn't have been there and therefore would not have suffered in the first place if the risks were appropriately priced--both California and Flordia have kept home insurance artificially low for years. Or their homes wouldn't have been destroyed because the proper pricing of insurance would effectively necessitate more durable designs.\n\nTo the extent the federal government provides any aid for predictable natural disasters, it should either be as a loan to smooth out the cost shock or as an insurance plan individual states buy into which is calibrated to its region's risk level. We already intuitively understand this as fair for quasi-predictable events that affect individuals: the federal government doesn't come running to buy you a new house if you neglect to buy homeowners insurance and a pipe bursts, flooding it. For healthcare, too, we either expect individuals to buy personal insurance plans or, in countries with universal/public coverage, negative externalities on risky consumption are appropriately taxed to offset its societal cost (eg taxes on alcohol, tobacco, fat, sugar etc.).\n\nWhere I do think the federal government should offer aid is for disasters/emergencies that are truly unforeseen like a meteor strike or a terror attack.

I'm not being rude to people for being under-educated, but I am tired of the confidence people of this demographic seem to have. \n\nLet's touch on a few points: \n\n\\- Romantic spaces: If someone is giving you really weird vibes, yes, please acknowledge that. At the same time, note also that if you were raised poorly, any unfamiliar situation is going to inherently feel weird. Your \"intuition\" is going to paint unfamiliarity as bad. Let's also acknowledge that with a 50% divorce rate, most of your intuition(s) are collectively, not that spectacular \n\n\\-Discomfort: Going off of what I just said, if you're uncomfortable, that isn't inherently a bad thing if you're living a shitty life. Next. \n\n\\-Any kind of isms:  People who have issues with various isms have negative feelings, and look to constantly re-justify the feelings they already feel. It doesn't matter how many positive interactions with a group they've had, for example, a sexist man is always going to think I'm stupid no matter how much I show I'm not stupid.

However, an actual Doctor who slaved away in medical school is not going to tell you the same thing, and isn't going to appeal to your not-always-rational anxiety. \n\n\\----Universities: A general disillusionment with society makes people distrust higher-education, which is alarming, because it's literally just more information designed to make them question their world views. It's more comforting to accept that others are plotting against you than to accept your world views on a lot of important topics are limited or wrong. \n\n\\----Cities: Deeply disturbing how there is an inherent distrust of cities... places of major intellectual and economic importance.

Modern media sucks (that’s what the mainstream reviewers won’t tell you) but progressive politics is not what’s ruining things (that’s what the social media influencer reviewers won’t tell you). All the progressive things that can be done to make a story more diverse and give demographics more representation can be done well and in some cases like the Owl House or Hazbin Hotel, they have been done well. Take the live action little mermaid remake. Everyone was talking about how race-swapping Ariel ruined it, but did it? Me personally I don’t care about who played Ariel I want to know if the story itself was well written, were the characters likable? And the answer to both of these questions is of course not. It was a soulless corporate cash grab like every other Disney live action remake. And here in lies the REAL problem with modern media. The big Hollywood executives aren’t interested in art they are interested in profit margins and so what they want is to mass produce blockbusters. So they’ve made a formula but it’s lacking something a secret ingredient. They’ve wokeness is just something they’re trying to see if it’s the secret ingredient and when they finally figure out it’s not they’ll go looking for a new ingredient. They’ll probably try AI next and those movies will suck even harder. But here’s the thing the ingredient they are looking for doesn’t exist. You can’t mass produce great movies. You need to put in the effort to make movies great it’s a craft not something that can be mass produced and retain value.

{"title": "Social media is breaking our brains", "article": "I'm a dinosaur who remembers what the world was like before it came along.  While I am grateful for many things that the internet has provided, life was better pre-social media in so many ways.  Just in the past few minutes of random browsing here on reddit, I came across 2 posts that cut to the core of my thoughts and feelings in it.  One was \"name one annoying thing that people base their entire identity around\" and another was \"here is a specific thing that some people base their entire identity around, and why I hate it\".  This whole thing with identity and ego.  Social media amplifies this problem where you only feel good about yourself when others \"like\" you, but then there is the question of who even ARE you... which most people answer by stating things that they \"like\" e.g., crossfit, gender identity, being a childless woman, being a trad wife.  It's all so asinine.  This is not how we should be defining ourselves.  Or rather, I'd argue that we should in fact STOP being so obsessed with defining ourselves, and get to work defining how we want to treat each other, and what kind of a world we want to live in.  \n\nWhen you spend time with other humans offline, as we all used to, there is no longer this pressing need to define yourself by what you \"like\", no longer this pressing need to define your personality \"type\" in relation to others.  In-person interactions (and phone calls kids! phone calls!) leave room for nuance, grey areas, perspective shifting, and the ability to be so much more than a one-dimensional representation with entertaining \"soundbites\".  \n\nAll that said, my particular \"social media identity peeve\" is the people making the self-help posts about being your \"authentic self\".  LOL.  It reminds me of when \"alternative\" music became mainstream.  They are making \"anti-social media\" the identity that they are using to generate their likes on social media.  And then here I am, on social media, hate-posting about the people who define themselves in opposition to the very things that I hate about social media simply because they are using social media to generate likes.

Guard dogs can prevent intruders from entering your home. They can also be useful when walking during the night or in insecure areas in general.\nHowever, dogs are prone to nibbling their feces and genitals, making their mouth a pool of germs. They can also carry dangerous bacteria such as Salmonella and parasites like Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Hence, they should be kept in your backyard, not inside your home.\n\nFor reasons other than convenience, I believe they're no more than a nuisance. A household is not a home for animals, as the captivity limits their natural behavior and places both their mental and physical well-being at risk.\n\nThink about it. Why do people need to walk their dogs? Because they need physical exercise, it's important for their mental health and walks are a major source of sensory input for a dog. All of these problems would've been solved had we not domesticated dogs in the first place. Animals are wild creatures with needs that drastically differ from humans. We cannot emprison them inside a 2 story building (let alone a one story building) for 8 hours until we come back from work.\n\nThis also applies to fish, birds, cats, and a many more. Except that the latter don't get the benefit of occasional walks and thus will never get a taste of the life mother nature intended for them.\n\nAnd as for the argument of companionship and emotional support provided by animals, I personally believe that relationships should be with humans, not animals (and yes I don't believe humans are animals nor that we evolved from monkeys).\n\n\nThis is just my opinion obviously, I was just curious to see if anybody else had a similar viewpoint 😁", "id": 216, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1i03t9w/we_shouldnt_own_any_pets/", "time": "2024-12-16"}

The app trains us to crave quick dopamine hits, shortening attention spans and replacing depth with fleeting, algorithm-driven trends. It’s like eating junk food for your brain: fun in the moment, but ultimately unfulfilling and harmful in the long run.\n\nWhile TikTok has sparked creativity, it’s also fueled toxic cycles of comparison, misinformation, and endless fo it for the Vine mentality that leave us mentally drained and more divided. Maybe a ban isn’t such a bad thing—it might force us to detox and reclaim our ability to focus on things that truly matter. Sometimes, the healthiest choice is stepping away, even if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOn the free speech angle:\nThe First Amendment guarantees that “Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech.” This provision is directed at government actions that suppress speech based on its content or viewpoint. However, the focus of a TikTok ban rest on national security and data privacy concerns, rather than the regulation of specific speech or ideas.\n\nIf the government can demonstrate that such a ban is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest—such as protecting sensitive user data from foreign surveillance—it may survive constitutional scrutiny under legal doctrines like the \"strict scrutiny test.\" Importantly, the ban would target the platform itself as a mechanism of data collection, not the content being shared on it. A ban on TikTok would not inherently prevent individuals from expressing themselves; it would merely restrict the use of a specific medium which qualify as a foreign government interaction via social media. The courts have long held that the government has the authority to regulate certain platforms or channels under specific conditions, provided alternative avenues for speech remain available. For instance, users could still express their ideas on other social media platforms, blogs, or public forums, thus preserving their ability to communicate and not trampling rights.\n", "id": 219, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hz2hsq/tiktok_should_be_banned_its_not_free_speech/", "time": "2024-09-16"}

The true godfather of Modern Conservatism is not Donald Trump, not even Steve Bannon and even Stephen Miller. It's Newt Gingrich.\n\nYes, many say that Gingrich started the division culture and that Gingrich is the one who started the republican tradition of \"own the libs\", the tribalism, the bloody battles and the division.. I don't know if he is the \"first\" but he is the first significant political figure who turned this tactic into an art. Gingrich is the one who cultivated the hatred of Clinton and the obsession with him and was one of the first to cultivate the distribution of conspiracies and \"fake news\"\n\nBut not just his behavior, lets take a deeper look in how Gingrich truly shaped modern Conservatism: Gingrich also shaped the ideology of modern Conservatism. His close relationship with Falwell the evangelical also illustrates this and the fact that he is one of the only Republicans from the old party who supports Trump. When you go over the \"Contract with America\" or Gingrich's 2010 book \"To Save America: Stopping Obama's Secular-Socialist Machine\", ​​it's a prototype of the modern conservatism and Project 2025 that Trump and his supporters are promoting. Lets look into the book's description:\n\n>In his blockbuster book To Save America, former Speaker of the House and bestselling author Newt Gingrich issues a dire warning for America. Gingrich argues that the big-spending, big-government programs and bureaucracies of the secular socialist Left are the greatest threat to our nation’s survival since the Civil War. By spending more than we can afford, sacrificing conservative values for the sake of easy answers, and electing the most liberal president ever, America is at risk for its very survival. The Obama administration is conspiring to transform our America of free enterprise, faith, and personal freedom into their America of endless bureaucracy, secularism, and state control—despite overwhelming opposition from the American people. “Our federal government is broken,” Gingrich states, “we must ‘replace, not reform’ our leaders and our policies.”\n\nJust read it!

{"title": "Infant Circumcision is Unnecessary and Harmful", "article": "A key component of ethical healthcare is the patient’s informed consent. Because a child is not legally competent to consent to a surgery, it is the parent’s responsibility to give or withhold consent by proxy. However, this responsibility does not mean that the parent has *carte blanche* to consent to anything they like. Forcing a permanent body modification on the body of another person is not a valid moral decision if the modification is not medically necessary. And yet, the most common body modification done in the United States–infant circumcision–comes nowhere near being necessary. Many of the reasons given in defense of infant circumcision are flawed. For example:\n\n*Circumcision lowers the risk of urinary tract infection in infants.* In fact, circumcised babies are [just as likely](https://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/mueller/) to contract UTI as intact babies.\n\n*It eliminates the risk of penile cancer.* Circumcised men can still get penile cancer. [One study](https://cdn.mdedge.com/files/s3fs-public/jfp-archived-issues/1997-volume_44-45/JFP_1997-04_v44_i4_carcinoma-in-situ-of-the-penis-in-a-76-y.pdf) in 1997 noted that Denmark, in which 1.6% of men were circumcised, had a lower rate of penile cancer than the USA, in which 60% to 80% of men were circumcised. \n\n*It lowers the risk of HIV.* If this were true, one would expect non-circumcising Denmark to have a higher HIV rate than the USA; instead, the opposite is the case. In 2022, there were 11.3 new HIV infections per 100,000 people in the [USA](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20there%20were%2031%2C800%20estimated%20new%20HIV,and%2087%25%20of%20estimated%20infections%20among%20all%20males.) compared to 1.9 per 100,000 in [Denmark](https://en.ssi.dk/surveillance-and-preparedness/surveillance-in-denmark/annual-reports-on-disease-incidence/hiv-2022). The HIV-prevention myth originates from three studies that were done in Africa and were riddled with [methodological problems](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Birx-letter-WHO-HIV-PEPFAR-circumcision-06-29-20.pdf). The conclusions of the African studies have also been disproved by a recent Canadian study of over half a million males in Ontario, which found that there is [no correlation](https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/JU.0000000000002234) between circumcision status and risk of HIV.\n\n*It can sometimes be necessary to treat phimosis.* A tight foreskin, also known as phimosis, is normal and natural in newborns, because the foreskin is fused to the glans. The foreskin usually loosens and retracts on its own by adolescence. If not, phimosis is easily treatable with plastic phimosis rings, which gently stretch the skin over the course of a few months.\n\n*A circumcised penis is cleaner than an intact penis.* Like any other body part, a foreskin will be clean if it is washed. The hygiene claim has no relevance for people who take showers.\n\n*A circumcised penis is aesthetic.* Since aesthetic appearance is a matter of personal preference, not of medical necessity, it ought to be left to the owner of the penis, when he is old enough to decide for himself.\n\n*A circumcised penis is still functional.* This is true in the sense that a circumcised penis can achieve erection and ejaculation, but there is more to sex than being able to reproduce. The penis is a sensory organ; losing part of it will entail a loss of sensory function.\n\nInfant circumcision is bad for the baby, and for the man he will become. Its harms include the following:\n\n–The infant’s suffering both during and after the surgery, which is [traumatizing](https://www.cirp.org/library/psych/goldman1/).\n\n–Loss of erogenous [nerve endings](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/for-professionals/sexual-impact/).\n\n–Loss of the natural gliding motion of the foreskin over the glans during sex, causing friction and vaginal dryness.\n\n–Loss of the protective cover which keeps the glans moist, soft, and sensitive. In a circumcised penis, the glans becomes dried out and keratinized, and loses most of its [erogenous sensitivity](https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x).\n\nThe medical profession has been aware of the sexual functions of the foreskin for a long time. In fact, infant circumcision is a fossil of nineteenth-century anti-masturbation pseudo-science. In the 1870s, certain American doctors began to speculate that masturbation was the underlying cause of all sorts of maladies—syphilis, paralysis, tuberculosis, and epilepsy, to name a few. Because the foreskin is densely packed with erogenous nerve endings, these doctors knew that its excision would reduce sexual sensitivity. In 1901, Dr. E.G. Mark [wrote](http://www.noharmm.org/docswords.htm) in American Practitioner and News:\n\n\"Pleasurable sensations are elicited from the extremely sensitive mucous membrane [of the foreskin], with resultant manipulation and masturbation. The exposure of the glans penis following circumcision … lessens the sensitiveness of the organ. It therefore lies with the physicians, the family adviser in affairs hygienic and medical, to urge its acceptance.\"\n\nPut differently, it was their intention to diminish sexual sensation. That is why infant circumcision became standard practice in the United States. Modern claims that it has no impact on male sexual health are either ill-informed or disingenuous.\n\nIn other developed countries, doctors advise against infant circumcision. For example, the Royal Dutch Medical Association [states](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/knmg-non-therapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-27-05-2010.pdf) that “there is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene.” By contrast, the United States has a for-profit medical industry, which recommends infant circumcision because it is profitable. Hospitals make money from circumcisions, then sell the foreskins to companies that harvest the keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are used to make skin substitutes such as [Apligraf](https://apligraf.com/pdf/Apligraf-FactSheet.pdf). As long as there is a profit incentive for the American medical industry to harvest babies’ foreskins, it will continue to push the procedure on parents who don’t know any better.\n\nWhy is this a taboo topic? Circumcised men do not want to admit that their penises are missing something, because it feels emasculating. Parents do not want to admit that they allowed their sons to be harmed. Doctors do not want to admit that they have harmed baby boys. There is a general unwillingness to face uncomfortable facts.\n\nInfant circumcision is a needless surgery on a perfectly healthy baby, designed to destroy a functional, healthy part of his penis. Attempts to justify it rest upon the conceit that half of the human race requires immediate surgical alteration at birth. Because it is unnecessary and harmful, it is also indefensible.", "id": 242, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hybkbr/infant_circumcision_is_unnecessary_and_harmful/", "time": "2024-12-03"}

And that to a woman being paid for sex by a man just feels like being violated. \n\nI've in the past visited my fair share of prostitutes and erotic massage places. And frankly I have never had this experience. I remember the first time I visited a prostitute. It was a middle aged woman, living in a large house in a posh village with expensive cars in their driveway. Her husband had his own business, her kids were in college. She simply enjoyed the thrill of being a typical suburban housewife by day, while secretly being a prostitute by night. \n\nAnd those types I've seen more often. It should be said they are not the 21 year old Asian women with the tight body, but usually 40+ housewives and often a bit overweight. Their motives can be; \n\n\\- Just having a very liberal mentality towards sex with strangers and seeing it as an easy way to make a living (or an extra income). \n\n\\- Being into specific fetishes. Especially in the BDSM scene or when their partner is a cuck who liked to watch (or sometimes the husband might join). \n\n\\- Sometimes, simply being paid for sex is the fetish. \n\nAnother example would be an erotic masseuse I really liked to visit because she is very good at her job. She told me that when she came to the Netherlands, she first worked in a warehouse for 9 hours a day doing harsh physical labor and was very depressed. She finds live as an erotic massage therapist much more relaxed plus one client for 1 hour a day is enough for her to get by so she has a lot of free time. \n\nA final example was a 26 year old college student, to who being paid for sex seemed to be a bucketlist thing she wanted to try. She was very exited and actually responded genuinely disappointed when I declined a blowjob for instance. \n\nSure, I admit that I'm cherry picking here, and these are not the majority of all prostitutes.

{"title": "Accepting Unattractiveness Is Like Death for a Woman", "article": "\nAdmitting you’re unattractive feels as taboo as discussing death because it forces people to confront uncomfortable truths they’d rather avoid. Society clings to platitudes like “Everyone is beautiful,” just as people use clichés to comfort the grieving, leaving no space for honest discussion.\n\nIt’s awkward because no one knows how to respond—agreeing feels cruel, but denying it feels fake. Saying you’re unattractive also exposes a vulnerability most people hide, making others confront their own insecurities about beauty. Ultimately, it feels like a social death, a loss of status and power, which society prefers to ignore rather than address.\n\n\n\nThe Stages of Grief in Accepting Unattractiveness:\n\n1. Denial\n\nAt first, you might convince yourself that beauty doesn’t matter. You tell yourself, \"It’s what’s inside that counts,\" even as the world screams otherwise. You cling to the hope that your personality, intelligence, or kindness will somehow override societal standards. Some women even fall into the \"i can't be ugly. it's because of sexism, racism, beauty standards, white people, bullies, colorist ect.\" \"It's not me, it's them\".\n\n2. Anger\n\nThis is where you confront the brutal truth: people are shallow, and the world revolves around appearances. The anger stems from cognitive dissonance—the clash between the belief that \"it’s what’s inside that counts\" and the reality that society values beauty above all else.\n\nYou’re enraged by the betrayal of ideals you grew up believing, like kindness or intelligence mattering more than looks. Watching beautiful people receive opportunities, admiration, and love while you’re overlooked feels like a slap in the face.\n\n3. Bargaining\n\nthis stage is about bargaining with reality: If I work hard enough, people will finally see me as beautiful. You think with enough effort, you can escape the prison of unattractiveness. You convince yourself that self-improvement is the key to acceptance, admiration, and love. \"Maybe it's not my looks. I just need a new hairstyle or get contact lenses\" Maybe you dive into makeup tutorials, lose weight, or overhaul your wardrobe, thinking that if you just try hard enough, you can \"fix\" yourself. You pray for a glow-up as though it’s a divine intervention, a miracle that will transform your life overnight. The pain of this stage comes from realizing that no amount of effort can guarantee the validation you’re seeking.\n\n4. Depression\n\nIn this stage, the hopelessness becomes overwhelming as you realize no amount of effort can change how society perceives you. You feel invisible, overlooked in both social and professional spaces, and lonely, disconnected from a world that seems to value beauty above all else.\n\nShame sets in, as society’s standards make you believe your appearance is a personal failing. Comparisons with others—especially on social media—fuel bitterness and self-loathing. You withdraw, avoiding situations where you feel judged or ignored, and question your worth, wondering if life will always feel this empty.\n\n5. Acceptance: The Hardest Thing a Woman Can Do In Her Life\n\nAcceptance is the most challenging stage because it requires rejecting the lifelong conditioning that ties a woman’s worth to her beauty. It means letting go of societal validation, knowing you may never receive the attention or admiration beauty affords, and instead defining your value on your own terms.\n\nYou stop chasing the beauty rat race—no more endless diets, makeup routines, or comparisons—and focus on what truly fulfills you, like your skills, relationships, and personal growth. It’s not easy; the world constantly reminds you of its obsession with appearance, and acceptance can feel isolating.\n\nBut it’s also freeing. Acceptance allows you to reclaim your identity, live authentically, and detach your worth from a shallow system. Though the pain of unfairness lingers, stepping off the hamster wheel of validation is a radical act of self-liberation.", "id": 252, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hz3w2c/accepting_unattractiveness_is_like_death_for_a/", "time": "2025-03-11"}

{"title": "Women have it WAY easier than men in dating.", "article": "A lot of people try to use a compromise or wishy washy tone here. But there's no need. Women have it a LOT easier in the dating world.\n\nThe reason is simple. Women have many, MANY more options. People who try to make the counter argument have various ways of trying to weasel out of this basic fact.\n\nFirst off, they try to paint having that many options as a disadvantage. They try to say that now they have to sift and find the good ones. I'm not saying sifting is always easy but it's much easier than having limited options.\n\nSecondly, a lot of people say it's harder because women run the risk of pregnancy. This seems valid but crumbles very quickly. First off, every form of invisible contraception is tailored for women. Every. single. one.\n\nSo, if a woman doesn't want to be pregnant, she can just use birth control. It really isn't that difficult. Or if that fails, she can get on a flight to the West Coast or Northeast and essentially pay for not being pregnant. No, I don't think women should have to travel like this at all, but they have this option. Men can't unilaterally book a trip to Seattle, Baltimore, or Chicago to escape a pregnancy. So, if anything, pregnancy potential is more of a disadvantage to the man who can't control what happens after.\n\nIt's very clear that women have the advantage. If a man wants to date, he has to hit the gym massively and get his money way up. Not bad things for sure, but a very high bar.\n\nOh, and also, he better hope he has good looks because if he's under 5'6 or has other bad looks he's SOL even if he does the above. Ask me how I know about the height disadvantage. I've LIVED it.\n\nWomen on the other hand don't need to do anything. If she exists, she will have options approach her. Also, she can literally just wear short shorts or a really short skirt and the amount of men approaching her will skyrocket.

I love cats but I belief domesticated  pet cats they should be mostly indoor just like dogs, however at least they are somewhat domesticated even though they still are likely causing harm to wildlife when let outside... I think feral cats should have been included in the predator free 2025 goal. The biggest issue is actually wild, grouchy, wild feral cats that breed relentlessly. No one owns these cats, they rely basically solely on the wildlife population for sustenance and there are many of them roaming free in New Zealand.   \n  \nNZ is trying to rejuvenate the population count of wildlife that evolved without cats. They are a apex predator and flightless birds are particularly susceptible as they cannot fly away or defend themselves. NZ should have a program to reduce wild cats populations and encourage domestic cats to be mostly kept indoors. Unlike other countries, there is no other predator to minimise or balance feral cats population, otherwise this may not be as big of an issue. Their population is getting out of control and unfortunately neutering wouldn't work super well as they may not be able to breed but they can still hurt bird populations. It is hard to minimise a population of something like this as they remind us so much of our fur babies and loved pets.  I have owned and looked after many pets in my life, including domestic cats that live mostly outside (which I may or may not have owned). My opinion comes after considering the topic for over 10 years and the delicate nature of NZ's wildlife. Domesticated dogs would never be allowed to roam free in modern day without risking it getting taken to the vets, SPCA or getting potentially put down by a local farmer trying to protect their stock (potentially). Again, I love cats and enjoy their company but I am also all for growing NZ's native wildlife populations, being as at risk as they already are thus far. There already is a similar program and incentive for wild possums, unlike in Australia where they are protected.\n\nPerhaps wildlife conservationists should start with managing populations of feral cats in NZ's public reserves first, where native birds are most likely to prosper and islands :) Then work their way into more populated areas?

Not only is it such a prevalent belief and idea to defend, people become extremely vitriolic and hostile when you point out that it’s… quite literally not the same thing.\n\nI have no idea why people defend this so fervently, because on its face it’s just objectively false. I would go as far as saying it’s a dangerous thing to keep repeating, considering the fact that we’re in the middle of a literacy crisis. No, having someone read a book to you is not the same as reading a book. When I was a toddler and my mom read books to me, that did not mean I could read. We are talking about separate skills entirely.\n\nThen, when you point this out they say “it uses the same part of your brain as reading the book!” like it matters at all. I’m sure similar areas of my brain are active when I do a variety of tasks throughout my day. That doesn’t mean tying my shoes is the same exact thing as brushing my teeth and I’m going to yell at you if you say there’s a difference.\n\nI don’t know if people say this objectively false statement because they just prefer audiobooks and want to say they “read” the book, but it’s such a ridiculous thing to defend. Why die on this hill? Nobody cares if you like audiobooks, it’s not an inherently better or worse way to enjoy your media.

I grew up in a traditional family, father is the breadwinner and mom was a stay at home mom until my oldest brother was a teenager. What I want is that same thing and life here (Canada) is too damn expensive for me to create that same kind of upbringing for my future family.\n\nNow unfortunately, this view I share is not the majority, most guys now who call themselves a passport bro do not want to live a traditional lifestyle, they just want to be a sex tourist, allow me to explain thoroughly so that whether you agree or not, you actually understand why.\n\nThere are too many guys who say they want to go to the ppb trinity: Thailand, Philippines, Colombia. When they go to these places, they talk about how they get 100 matches on dating apps and how they had lots of sex because “it’s so easy.” \n\nThe worst part is, they bash western women (women who grew up in the Anglo sphere countries regardless of race) for partaking in hook up culture and sleeping with so many men yet what are they trying to do? They want easy sex. They go to places like pattaya and Medellin which are known for sex t0urism and bar girls who they can pay for services.\n\nLots of guys purposely avoid and advise other to avoid countries and cities where women will not sleep with a man unless they want to marry them. Why lie though? Just be honest, you want power, you don’t care about living a traditional life because you actively avoid actual traditional women, whether they’re in a western country or not.\n\n**TLDR:** These guys go to the most sexualized cities in countries where they can easily pay for services.

{"title": "Jordan Peterson isn't that hard to understand, you just aren't as smart as you think you are. ", "article": "I love JP and I conclude that after listening to him on his podcast or youtube I do often have to stop, rewind, and listen to what he said again to understand what he means. He does use a lot of big words. But if you claim that he just makes nonsense statements and compare him to Deepak Chopra, you probably have a gap in your understanding of different belief systems. \n\nPeterson’s framework for understanding the world is rooted in a combination of evolutionary psychology, archetypal narratives, and a Christian moral outlook. People who approach these topics from a different framework—such as postmodernism, social constructivism, or purely empirical science—may find his arguments alien or difficult to grasp. Although he does dodge the question of God, he basically starts from the perspective that God exists, or at least that objective morality exists. I think a lot of the confusion about his statements starts from there. I was raised Christian (still am, but was raised that way too), but I think if you're not really familiar with the Christian worldview, or at least an Abrahamic one, which isn't materialist, that's a stumbling block for many to understanding what he's talking about. \n\nHis ideas often also leave room for interpretation, which can lead to misunderstandings. For example, his discussions on hierarchies, order vs. chaos, and the importance of traditional structures can be interpreted in vastly different ways, depending on your perspective. What I've found with people who find him hard to understand or hate him is that he takes the perspective that hierarchies are necessary, in the sense that they will always exist because they are a part of nature, as an attempted justification of the hierarchies exactly as they are now. Peterson's definitely a conservative, but most of his work is about how we can't get rid of hierarchies in general, not that hierarchies should never be altered. \n\nIt's also true that when he talks, even about a simple question, he often starts talking about things in multiple disciplines, linking psychology to sociology, biology, and literature too (guy loves Russian literature and the Bible). This makes his arguments complex, layered arguments that require listeners to follow long trains of thought. This can be difficult if you want a simple answer, which is frustrating for even me (like you talk about God all the time Jordan, how can you possibly tell people you don't know what they mean when they ask you if you believe in Him?), but it doesn't mean he's full of shit. It makes him a university professor (try reading Lacan if you want a hard read). He deals with questions at a very deep level. \n\nBasically, you can call him totally wrong and evil if you want, I don't care that much. He's not me. But it's not like he makes no sense. I think people who think he makes no sense just want a really quick, snarky answer, and that's not always the right way to be. Sometimes you need someone like him to really think deeply about something. \n\n", "id": 283, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hxrmtn/jordan_peterson_isnt_that_hard_to_understand_you/", "time": "2025-02-25"}

Canadians have this inferiority complex that is despicable to me. Actively finding flaws in their southern neighbors, but turning a blind eye to their own. All rooted in resentment and jealousy because not only does the USA have a larger economy, but is successful in growing it and producing successful contributions to the world. Like the arts industry, tech, aviation, finances...even successful Canadian actors and singers wind up living in California. The Canadian economy has been stagnating at around 2 trillion. 4 years ago, the US economy was at 21 trillion. Now, it's 27 and growing fast. Plus, salaries are higher in some industries and cost of living is lower in most parts of the US excluding the top famous cities. In addition, Canadians who would like to avoid the cold such as the snowbirds, they now would have unlimited time to stay in Florida without restrictions set by immigration law.\n\nThe only downsides are healthcare and safety. But healthcare is context-dependent and a lot of Canadians assume Americans pay out of pocket which is pretty ignorant, but they'll eventually figure it out. Most people have insurance for themselves so we should learn the concept of self reliance instead of demanding freebies. Healthcare should be free only for those who can't take care of themselves due to extraordinary circumstances such being mentally disabled. But for the majority, they just have to treat it like dental insurance. It's not a significant impact really plus you get perks of privatized healthcare including short wait times and access to experimental futuristic treatments if you really want to pay for it. The current system of banning health insurance is ridiculous. Healthcare in the US functionally has the right idea. It's just the costs, but that can be solved. Finally for guns, that's controversial because a proportion of Canadians were not happy with Trudeau's actions of banning guns from law-abiding citizens in response to criminals who obtained their guns illegally. As for shootings and crime, they're mostly done by poor people. It's highly unlikely they have the finances to move up north and stir trouble if the border is removed. For mass shootings, besides Detroit and Buffalo, the other American cities that are considered dangerous are pretty far away.

The CCP uses visual techniques to make Chinese infrastructure projects like Chinese bridges, highways or tunnels look emotionally appeasing to the gullible and dissaloussioned. The idea that Chinese infrastructure is superior to American infrastructure is false just like many of the other talking points the CCP uses in its propaganda.\n\nSimple research reveals that there have already been many infrastructure projects in the US which have been completed recently (2010s and 2020s) and are still in use.

The issue is completely gone if you record in your own home, ***yet some cities still require permits for private property.***\n\nThe law is vague enough that monetizing your channel, or even just uploading at all, makes you required to let the city council know two weeks in advance (which isn’t good for spontaneity), potentially get the county involved too, cough up the money, and recognize that they think it’s fair to stea-confiscate your camera and cen-destroy your footage if you don’t follow.

{"title": "The Truth Behind the Manipulation: A Call to Wake Up and Stand Together", "article": "We are living in a time where the truth is increasingly difficult to find, not because it’s hidden, but because the very institutions meant to inform us are the ones manipulating the narratives we’re fed. It’s time we wake up to the reality of what’s happening around us, not just in our country, but globally. The media and our government have been controlling the story for far too long, and we’ve let it happen by failing to question, by failing to critically analyze what we’re told.\n\nThe History of Propaganda and Manipulation\n\nThe manipulation we’re witnessing today isn’t new. In fact, it’s been happening for centuries. Take, for example, the story we were all taught about Christopher Columbus. We were told that he “discovered” America, that he was a brave explorer seeking new lands. But the truth is much darker. Columbus’s arrival marked the beginning of the genocide of indigenous people and the pillaging of their land. The narrative that we were fed in school was crafted to justify the horrors of colonization and to sanitize the violence and exploitation that followed. It’s a narrative that erases the real history and hides the atrocities committed in the name of expansion. The idea that we “discovered” land that was already inhabited is a complete distortion of reality and one of the oldest propaganda tactics used to maintain power and control.\n\nAnd this type of manipulation didn’t stop there. In the U.S., during World War II, the government created the Office of Wartime Information, which produced propaganda to shape how we saw the Japanese and other nations. This is the same tactic we’ve seen throughout history: an external enemy is created and exaggerated to maintain control. And this doesn’t end there. When we look at the Holocaust, it’s essential to acknowledge that there’s only one true German viewpoint documentary on the war. The rest are heavily shaped by the perspectives of the Allied forces, mainly the U.S. This isn’t to diminish the tragedy of the Holocaust, but rather to remind us that history itself can be bent to fit a narrative—and not always the one we’ve been taught.\n\nThe New Orleans Situation: Manipulation at Its Finest\n\nOne of the most recent and deeply troubling examples of media manipulation came with the tragic attack in New Orleans on New Year’s Day. A man, allegedly connected to ISIS, drove a truck into a crowd of people, killing 14. Following the attack, the FBI raided his home. The next day, New York Post reporter, Jennie Taer , was allowed to walk freely through the crime scene, which was disturbingly pristine, showing an organized bookshelf, an open Quran, a prayer rug, and a pair of shoes placed in front of them.\n\nThis alone raised numerous red flags. It didn’t take long for people to see through this blatant manipulation. The man’s home appeared meticulously staged, almost as though someone wanted to paint a picture of the attack that fit a specific narrative—one that would once again fuel anti-Muslim sentiment. In every comment section I’ve read, not one person believes this attack wasn’t staged or manipulated in some way. This is a clear example of how our government and media can engineer public perception, and it’s time we start questioning the motives behind it.\n\nMainstream Media Today: The Scripted Reality\n\nFast forward to today, and it’s clearer than ever that the media operates on a script. Have you ever noticed that no matter which news outlet you turn to, the stories are almost identical? The same talking points, the same wording, often in sync across major news stations. This is no accident. It’s the result of a controlled narrative that’s carefully curated and distributed by those in power. The media isn’t here to inform us; they’re here to shape our views, divide us, and ultimately keep us in a state of fear and confusion. This is how they keep us from seeing the bigger picture, how they distract us from the reality of our collective power.\n\nThe Role of TikTok and Censorship\n\nOne of the most glaring examples of this manipulation today is the growing push to ban TikTok in the U.S. Since its rise, TikTok has become a platform for the free exchange of ideas, knowledge, and perspectives—things the mainstream media can’t control. It’s allowed us to see behind the curtains of government and corporate control, to hear from people outside of the narrative they’ve built. And that’s why the powers that be are threatened. They don’t want us to connect with each other, to share information that challenges their narrative. They want us in the dark, dependent on their controlled media outlets to tell us what’s real.\n\nTikTok may have its fair share of misinformation, but that’s a problem we can address with critical thinking and discernment. The solution isn’t to censor it, but to encourage education and media literacy. Banning TikTok is about silencing the voices that don’t fit the narrative—voices that are challenging the status quo.\n\nPalestine and Israel: A Reflection on Our Own History\n\nThe ongoing conflict between Palestine and Israel has its own roots in territorial disputes, much like the colonial mindset that has plagued the world for centuries. But here’s the part that makes me question the role of the U.S. in supporting either side: Imagine if the roles were reversed. Imagine if, as Americans, we decided to go back to Europe and reclaim the land our ancestors once occupied simply because we feel entitled to it. We wouldn’t be well-received, and rightfully so. Just because our ancestors came from there doesn’t mean we have any rightful claim to that land now, and we’d likely be met with resistance if we tried to impose ourselves on that land.\n\nSo why are we getting involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Shouldn’t we be striving for peace and unity, not taking sides in a conflict that has nothing to do with us? We, as a nation, should be the ones leading efforts for peaceful resolution between all nations—not taking sides in conflicts that are far older and more complex than we could ever understand. Our interference in such matters only fuels further division and hatred. We should be working toward solutions that benefit humanity as a whole, not pushing one group over another. Our involvement should be focused on creating bridges, not building walls.\n\nCall to Action: Unity, Love, and Peace\n\nWe are at a crossroads. We have been manipulated, divided, and led to believe that we are powerless in the face of the powers that control us. But the truth is, if we came together—if we united in love, understanding, and peace—we would be an unstoppable force. It’s not about overthrowing anyone, but about reclaiming our collective power and creating a society where everyone, not just the elite few, has the chance to thrive.\n\nSo, I ask you: let’s wake up. Let’s stop accepting the narratives that are being fed to us. Let’s question what we’re told, challenge the systems of control, and work together to build a world that is based on truth, love, and understanding—not fear and division.??", "id": 317, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hxjocp/the_truth_behind_the_manipulation_a_call_to_wake/", "time": "2025-03-24"}

{"title": "Billionaires and other super wealthy people should give less to charity and focus on high-impact businesses", "article": "There's this common narrative that billionaires and other super-wealthy people need to give all of their money to charity before they die. That they owe it to society. But, I think that billionaires should give less to charity and spend more of it on high-impact businesses.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Great examples are Tesla and SpaceX. Tesla, as a private corporation, has captured a large share of the global EV market. SpaceX, as a private corporation, is way ahead of any private or government entity in terms of launch price and capability. And these amazing things were accomplished without charitable donations, and they also supply thousands of jobs (OK, OK, I know you are about to open your mouths to argue about this, but just consider that charity by itself probably would not have been able to accomplish this).\n\nAnother example I like to use is diabetes. When you think of trying to cure diabetes, it is usually in the case of detection (blood sugar), mitigations, or some kind of drug that moderates blood sugar. Add to that numerous research labs (some academic, some corporate) that are all busy attacking various problems. But so much of this is just nibbling around the edges! I feel like nobody has really tried to attack the problem directly, such as with tissue regeneration. They've done it in mice. Why not just spend 50 billion dollars on some method that could directly cure the disease? I guarantee you that the first billionaire to create a company for this problem and solve it would become the first trillioniare. And probably get a horse's head in his bed. Again, you can argue with this point, but I think you get the idea.\n\nIn summary, I think the profit motive is a great way for billionaires to spend money, since they have the money to achieve escape velocity in a lot of areas, can pursue many avenues that governments are not interested in, and can employ many people. It's just a much better proposition, and there are numerous ideas one could use.", "id": 323, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hxhkw4/billionaires_and_other_super_wealthy_people/", "time": "2024-08-22"}

Persecution of Jews in Germany was legal. Marital rape was legal in most places until the late 20th Century and still is in some places). Secondly, many of the situations that result in the retort \"their house their rules\" are describing illegal situations, such as abuse via social or emotional neglect, or coercive control (in British legislation since 2015). Thirdly, even in cases where it's not clearly against the law based on the limited information given, people who use this phrase don't make any effort to first ascertain if the situation is part of a wider pattern which is against the law. All of this indicates they aren't really bothered about the legality of the situation and are only bothered about compliance with the dictum of \"my house my rules\".\n\nBased on your own words (don't deny it, take responsibility for what comes from your own mouth), you also believe that children do not have a right to a home until they're in an economic situation to live alone. So in the interest of consistency, you should also never ask children or adults living with their parents/guardians what they do at home - you should now only ask them \"what do you do in your parent's home?\"\n\nYou also do not believe in conflict resolution or attempting to negotiate compromises, if your primary response is \"their house their rules, move out if you don't like it\" to people without basic personal freedoms.

After winning a massive, brutal war against regimes that dehumanized large portions of their populations, the western Allies could have done a lot of horrific things back. Instead, they didn’t even keep the conquered territory (save for a few island colonies in the Pacific, but that was mostly temporary).\n\nRather than subjugate and humiliate their former opponents, the Allies and especially the US rebuilt them as functional, productive, democratic, and non-aggressive societies. Look at the world today: people all over drive cars, use products, and consume culture from Germany and Japan, and they’re among the richest countries in the world. After a century or more of Europe fearing German invasion, that’s basically an impossibility at this point—and few of us can even understand why anyone would want to do that to begin [with.It](http://with.It) fills with me joy about how America is responsible for a(mostly)peaceful Europe over the past 70 years and Japan being the country it is today!Plus as a bonus South Korea becoming a prosperous rich nation and defending against an invasion of the north.The thought of an entire Korean Peninsula being united with the north as communism sounds awful to me and had America not existed South Korea would just be another part of North Korea.And before anyone brings up the Soviet Union and how those countries are basically America's,\"puppet states\",etc.\n\nCompared to how the soviet union treated their puppet states,I would much rather be in an\"American puppet state\".Those American \"puppet states\" have some of the highest living standards in the world and in a new age of peace and democracy with hundreds of millions of people living in the most peaceful time in human history.The best thing Germany and Japan did was go to war with the US,and my heart is broken over how the Soviet Union treated their sphere on influence after WW2 compared to how the US treated theirs.I love America SM", "id": 364, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hx2eba/america_is_a_bastion_of_peace_to_the_west_and_i/", "time": "2024-10-15"}

{"title": "AI might soon kill us all and nobody cares", "article": "I believe we are quite close to achieving superintelligent AI. My longest likely timeline is something on the order of 10 years. My shortest likely timeline is as little as 2 years. In any case, it seems like we are not many conceptual insights away from an AI that can automate remote work at superhuman quality and speed. This would imply that it is close to automating AI research and development itself, which is very likely to kick off a process of self-improving AI systems that rapidly get themselves to levels of intelligence that can only be described as god-like to us. It should be obvious why that is threatening. \n\nI say this because the latest models are getting impressively good scores on tests of mathematics at the highest levels and performing some abstract reasoning tasks at near-human performance (OpenAI's o3 model with the FrontierMath and ARC-AGI tests). It was only one year ago when AI models would get nearly no questions right of the types that appear on these tests. As far as those of us who do not work in a frontier AI lab can tell, it took just one conceptual insight to get AI to this level, something called chain-of-thought, the details of which are outside the scope of this post. This single technique took AI models from being mere statistical token-predictors to doing something that resembles actual reasoning. \n\nThe bleeding-edge models of today are, of course, still limited. They require extraordinary amounts of energy, are not capable of carrying out longer-term tasks, and are inferior to humans at certain kinds of reasoning. But just as one insight took AI from near-zero reasoning ability to non-trivially greater-than-zero reasoning ability, it may not take many additional insights to fix these issues. Heck, we may already have all the insights we need and just need to scale up models. After all, the difference between our brains and those of chimpanzees is not that they fundamentally differ in the kind of processing they do. We just have way more neural synapses. \n\nThe problem with rushing ahead with AI capabilities to the extent that tech companies have been is that we have no idea how to make it value keeping us alive, happy, and free. If it does not value those things, then there is a very good chance of a bad outcome when it gets to superhuman capability. If it does not care about our existence, then what would stop it from killing us in the pursuit of the things that it actually does care about? For example, why would it not boil away the Earth's oceans to power the fusion reactors that provide the energy it uses? Do not get caught up on that specific scenario. It is just meant to illustrate the basic concept. Until this problem is solved, we should not attempt to improve AI capability beyond where they are now.\n\nIt greatly frustrates me that there is no political or social will to address this issue. The government seems perfectly content with letting tech companies continue their reckless AI development. It should instead ban them from continuing this research and work on an international treaty to enforce the ban abroad, but it does not seem interested in pursuing that. If we had any hope at all, much of it was lost with the election of Trump, as he is right in the pockets of the technologists who run these companies. As for the technologists themselves, they have deluded themselves into buying into various specific scenarios for how we can make it through this alive. But these beliefs are a result of rationalizing their preferred conclusion of achieving superhuman AI while avoiding AI catastrophe than any actual forward reasoning from the underlying principles governing intelligent systems. Furthermore, much of the electorate seems blissfully unaware of where AI is headed and therefore could not care less, instead choosing to focus on more transient issues. Oh well, what can you do? I can only try and make people aware of these issues and hope it has some sort of impact.

{"title": "Modern atheism has become so toxic, cult-like, and anti-religion that it has ironically become a religion itself", "article": "I believe the majority of atheists are sensible people who simply do not believe in the concept of a higher power such as God, such as myself. However, I am disgusted at how modern atheism has become a toxic anti-religion echo chamber online by a large minority of radicalised vocal individuals.\n\nWikipedia defines religion as \"*range of social-cultural systems, including designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relate humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements—although there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion*\".\n\nTherefore, I argue that pure atheism is a standardised, stringent set of systems, behaviours, and practices that purely originate from personal conviction and worldviews. It must not originate from reactionary opposition to religious belief, nor should it be defined by the hostility that some radicalised atheists express toward religious communities. Instead, atheism in its purest form should be understood as a philosophical stance on the lack of an existence of a higher power, reached through individual reflection, not groupthink or tribalism.\n\nAtheism should not become, paradoxically, a quasi-religion of anti-religion. When atheism adopts a rigid orthodoxy of hostility toward belief, it risks becoming the very thing it seeks to oppose: an ideological system rooted in dogma and intolerance. True atheism, I believe, should not concern itself with tearing down religious traditions but instead focus on affirming a worldview based on secular ethics and rational intellectual inquiry.\n\nMany online atheist communities, particularly on certain subreddits, focus excessively on mocking the worst aspects of religion without offering a thoughtful, purist atheist perspective. Instead of exploring secular ethics or existential meaning, they reduce atheism to reactionary ridicule, turning it into a shallow opposition rather than a meaningful worldview. Members of these communities often perpetuate a bleak life-outlook of helplessness, depression, and a void of meaning, when in truth, pure atheism can offer just as much purpose, fulfillment, and moral clarity as religion.\n\nIn short, atheism should be a personal conclusion, not a crusade.\n\nTLDR: Atheism should be a personal conclusion, not an anti-religion crusade. Many online atheist communities focus on mocking religion, promoting a bleak outlook, but pure atheism can offer just as much purpose and meaning as religion when rooted in secular ethics and rational inquiry.", "id": 406, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hulxy0/modern_atheism_has_become_so_toxic_cultlike_and/", "time": "2025-03-26"}

There appears to be a widespread misconception that you cannot consent to anything when you're drunk. I think that this misunderstanding is a product of college sexual assault briefings, which cause people to blur the lines between a legal and moral conception of consent.\n\nPeople seem to not get that there's a difference between legal intoxication (or too drunk to drive) and being incapacitated. You can consent to almost anything with a BAC of 0.08 from a legal standpoint. If you are able to walk around, you can probably consent. Additionally, there is a difference between voluntary and involuntary intoxication. An adult should know that consuming an intoxicant will make them drunk.\n\nI believe that colleges do everyone a disservice by not offering some kind of disclaimer by saying that someone who has consumed alcohol is unable to give consent, because that standard has no teeth outside of the institution's policies and probably causes people to take more risky behaviors than they would otherwise.", "id": 418, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hukzfz/the_college_discourse_on_consent_has_done_more/", "time": "2024-06-18"}

{"title": "Rush Trip are Superior to Slow Trips", "article": "Coming from a middle class perspective, I believe that rush trips are vastly superior to slow trips. I hate how slow travel is labeled as a virtue. The idea of staying in one place for weeks at a time assumes you have the resources to do so. For those on tight budgets or with limited time off, slow travel just isn't worth it.\n\nI travel when I get bored of my day to day life, and I travel to see what I want to see. By the end of my trip, I want to feel exhausted and be able to ponder what the fuck just happened for weeks on end. Travelling is almost always more expensive than not travelling - so taking one's sweet time, sleeping in and \"soaking in the destination\" is extremely inefficient. When you travel, you're paying more to be alive - so you should diversify your expenses. I hate sleeping at the same hotel for 2 nights, because you're paying double for the same experience. I hate eating at the same restaurant twice (while travelling), because no matter how good the food may be, you're paying double for a similar experience. Therefore, spending too much time in the same place is also a waste of money. Plus, most places in the world are just not interesting enough to warrant more than 1-2 days of intensive sightseeing. I have been bored out by some of the world's most lauded big cities, such as Los Angeles and Beijing, but also by some smaller destinations that backpackers spend weeks in - like Lake Atitlan - simply because I spent too much time in them.\n\nPeople say that rush trips are forgettable and that slow trips are more \"meaningful\" and \"memorable.\" On the contrary, I've found that cramming the absolute maximum amount of destinations into my limited vacation days at the lowest price possible actually makes a short amount of time feel longer. I have planned trips under this philosophy for the past 3 years and instantly stopped feeling bored. I'm headed off to Chile, Argentina and Brazil this summer (winter in SA) and have planned 1 day in Santiago, 1 day in Valparaiso, 1 day in Montevideo, 1 day in Colonia del Sacramento, 2 days in Buenos Aires, 1 day in Posadas/San Ignacio, 1 day at the Iguazu Falls, 1 day in Brasilia, 1 day in Salvador de Bahia, 1 day in Fortaleza, 2 days in Rio and 1 day in Sao Paulo. The sheer pace of the trip might look overwhelming but I find so much thrill in flying from city to city and sleeping in overnight buses every other day - at the absolute lowest cost possible, abusing long layovers, multi-city flight ticketing, and dirt cheap buses/trains.\n\nDon't get me wrong - wasting daylight hours on long buses and trains is a colossal waste of efficiency. But when you can dash from place to place while staying the minimum amount of time needed to see what you want to see, all the diverse experiences you have stack up, and you end up with more stories to tell.", "id": 422, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hv7lgq/rush_trip_are_superior_to_slow_trips/", "time": "2024-08-28"}

From groceries to electronics everything is cheaper. A flat screen TV was a sign of wealth when I was a kid. Now they are so cheap people put them in their bathrooms. 30 years ago cellphones were a luxury item now they are not only standard but can do ridiculously more.\n\nThat's another thing. Our standard of living has gotten so high what was luxury 20 years ago is economy. Take your average car. Our current economy cars have navigation, power windows, power mirrors, back up cameras, Bluetooth radios, apple carplay and all that. You ever seen what cars where like even before that? My 96 is a manual and doesn't even have a techometer. I was talking to a guy a while back that had a 60's Camero.

I'm just saying overall it's massively better today and we do not need a revolution. We can fix the problems we have peacefully. Hell the federal government has already been taken steps in the housing direction to make it more affordable.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention income has doubled since the 60's and the middle class is disappearing because so many people are joining the upper middle class.\n\nEdit 2: even with the housing issues we have right now home ownership is higher than most of US history. The peak was 2020 right before the housing crisis at 69% it's now 64%. To put that in perspective it was around 57% in the 50's. Even in that regard you are better off now than most of US history.

These people don't seem to understand that it's cheaper due to the US dollar being much stronger and them having significantly more money than the average person in those countries. This is literally no different than people who become wealthy and now can afford the best things here in the US. \n\nI also notice that these people also don't tend to assimilate to the culture in those countries. They live among other expats, are content creators or \"entrepreneurs\". They aren't working for the same wages as the people there so they don't understand how hard/easy life can be there. \n\nI also notice many of these people never lived anywhere but the city/suburb/small town they were in and will bash America based on things they never saw. Seeing people talk about \"There's fruit with seeds in these countries\" is so crazy, especially if they're in a country the US exports fruits and vegetables to.

I own a pitbull. \n\nI can understand on the one hand how everyone wants them gone, but I really think they shouldn’t be banned but instead people should have licenses (or some other type of proof that they have an actual well mannered pitbull. \n\nWhen it comes down to it. It’s mostly backyard breeding or in household breeding. Or people who only get pitbulls just to say they can/have owned one. \n\nNobody really ever takes the time to learn and understand pitbull language.\n\nI really think if more people were aware or if more people understood dogs and pitbulls (the purebreds are the scary ones, their sizes alone intimidate but not every purebred is aggressive either) it is literally down to the owners/people who want the dogs. \n\nThe people who actually get pitbulls for the right reasons should not have to suffer. If pitbulls were to ever get banned in the US as a whole (I live in a state where they’re not banned) I would be devastated. \n\nBecause of a handful of reckless and ignorant people who don’t deserve the breed the right owners are hurt in the end. \n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nSince you wanted to instantly block me after being so disrespectful this is what I have to say to you @ProbablyLongComment \n\nI *am* a victim of assault and rape, I really appreciate you being an ass and assuming things you have no business assuming though, thank you. I was 21 and that was my first experience with a guy that I called a friend. Yay, I absolutely deserved it because I didn’t notice the signs. That’s absolutely not one of the big reasons why I go to therapy.\n\nPitbulls are territorial, they are protective, they are loyal and they are loving, not every pitbull you see or meet will want to bite your hand off.\n\nDon’t give me the “no other breed does this”, I’ve seen Golden Retriever’s aggressive, I’ve seen plenty of smaller dogs aggressive, I’ve seen other big dogs that you wouldn’t even guess they’re aggressive but they are. It’s not the breed, it’s all dogs. All dogs have issues. All dogs are protective and loyal.\n\nI appreciate the suggestion, however it is on the other side of one side of the family, I personally had no say in how the dogs were mated and even how the puppies got to be raised before we got my dog (till 8 weeks old) Maybe you should think twice before being a dick to somebody just because you disagree and your views don’t align with theirs.\n\nI have learned for many years how to diffuse tense situations, my dog has been attacked twice because he didn’t want to defend himself. There was another fight at the dog park (way before we stopped taking him there) when my dog was four months old and it was in the big dogs area. Two dogs were going at it and I was about ready to hop the large fence to help and break it up when others had already gotten there.\n\nThank you again for the suggestion, but I think I know plenty about dogs, how to stop breeding (as my own dog is not fixed, I don’t allow for situations like that to happen), I am always attentive and responsible because I have to be, and considering I own a Pitbull, I know a lot of what I’m talking about.\n\nAlso, don’t go uselessly assuming things about people, just from a small tidbit of information from their lives.", "id": 443, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hv90gf/pitbulls_should_be_banned_worldwide_no_they/", "time": "2024-08-10"}

{"title": "CANADIANS ONLY: Pierre Poilievre is going to be PM, and not only are you going to be fine, you're going to be better off than under Trudeau.", "article": "You can tell how close Poilievre is to being PM by how much Canadian reddit discussions focus on him. Now that Trudeau is screwed, and any replacements for him before an election has to be called are probably going to be Kim Campbelled, left-wing Reddit is focusing heavily on attacking him. These attacks are mostly not substantive, and this post includes a few reasons why. \n\n1. \"He has no policy/ only attacks Trudeau/ only has empty slogans!\"\n\nAs the Leader of Opposition, he doesn't have to put forth policy proposals. That isn't his job. His job is to hold the government to account. This, by nature, means that he will do more attacking the government than putting forth policy proposals. It also means he's going to do a lot of attacking Trudeau - that is his job. It's true, he's a lot more curt than other conservatives about doing it, and says mean words sometimes. This, in my view, is a good thing. Why should politics be about being nice all the time, especially when your opponent hates you, and your opponent has written the rules of engagement for the last hundred years? And considering Trudeau has done a remarkably shit job of being PM, it's good that he hits hard and plays a little dirty. Canada has had remarkably pussy-whipped conservatives for a while, and you should be thankful one of them has realized there's a market for being aggressive against a radlib Prime Minister.\n\nAlso, the slogans are working. \"Ax The Tax\" isn't the most complex piolicy proposal, but it's in your head, and you're talking about it. That's the point. Don't get mad about it, get mad that your guys aren't as good at branding. That's why Poilievre does them.\n\nAlso - he does have policy, it's just that it's not advantageous for him to reveal it now. That would make him the focus of the media cycle, and that would allow our radlib press to just deconstruct him rather than reporting on anything else.  But with that said, here's a list of policy proposals which will probably be a part of his campaign when the writ drops (sourced from ChatGPT, admittedly):\n\n**Economic Policy:**\n\n* **Balanced Budgets:** Introduce a \"pay-as-you-go\" law requiring the government to offset any new spending with equivalent cuts elsewhere to control deficits and combat inflation.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Bank of Canada Reforms:** Replace the Governor of the Bank of Canada, audit the institution, and

Canadians.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Housing and Infrastructure:**\n\n* **Increase Housing Supply:** Mandate major cities with unaffordable housing to boost new home construction by 15% annually, with federal infrastructure funding tied to these targets.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Utilize Federal Properties:** Sell 15% of under-utilized federal buildings to convert them into affordable housing units.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Airport Expansion:** Approve the expansion of the runway at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport to allow jet operations, enhancing competition in the aviation sector.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Environment and Energy:**\n\n* **Carbon Tax Repeal:** Eliminate the federal carbon tax, viewing it as detrimental to the economy.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Promote Green Technology:** Focus on technological solutions like carbon capture and storage to address climate change, rather than taxation.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Energy Independence:** Ban foreign oil imports and revisit previously canceled pipeline projects to boost domestic energy production.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Healthcare:**\n\n* **Support Public Healthcare:** Commit to maintaining Canada's public healthcare system.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Address Healthcare Shortages:** Implement interprovincial standardization for doctors and nurses through a \"Blue Seal\" program and expedite credential recognition for internationally trained health professionals.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Uphold Healthcare Funding:** Honor existing healthcare funding agreements with provinces, while advocating for increased funding.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Immigration:**\n\n* **Adjust Immigration Levels:** Link immigration numbers to housing availability and public service capacity, proposing reductions in asylum seekers and temporary residents to align with Canada's infrastructure.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Enhance Border Security:** Strengthen measures against illegal immigration, including amending the Safe Third Country Agreement and reinstating visa requirements for certain countries.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Social Issues:**\n\n*

matters.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Same-Sex Marriage:** Support same-sex marriage, acknowledging its success in Canada.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Drug Policy:** Oppose the decriminalization of hard drugs, advocating for increased treatment and recovery services for individuals with addictions, and propose legal action against pharmaceutical companies contributing to the opioid crisis.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Foreign Policy:**\n\n* **International Relations:** Criticize international organizations like the World Economic Forum, expressing opposition to their agendas, and propose banning ministers and top government officials from attending their annual summits. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_leadership_election?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n  \n2. \"He's never had a job!\"\n\nThat would be a valid point if he were running against a party of people who had jobs. He is not. If you were willing to vote for Trudeau, who has nursed at the government teat his whole life, you cannot make this argument against voting for Poilievre.  And while government experience isn't ideal for a conservative, he's had a lot of cabinet positions.\n\n3. \"He's an extremist/He's a Nayzi!\"\n\nHe is not. The core of his campaign is getting rid of a tax. It's about as milquetoast of a conservative goal as you can get. \n\n4. \"He's gonna ban abortion!\"\n\nAbortion is pretty much Canada's second most sacred cow after healthcare. We made Mortengaler a member of the OOC. As sourced from ChatGPT, he won't personally touch abortion. I do concede that if he gets over 250 seats the Conservatives may have a free vote on some issue like banning late-term abortion and that may pass. That's as far as it's going to get. You're going to be able to kill as many babies for as long as you want.\n\n5. \"He's working for the oligarchs!\"\n\nThis is the best liberal point, and would be a good point if it weren't that the Liberals are also the oligarch party in Canada. In fact more so. Canada is basically a state of Oligarchs. Air Canada, the banks, the housing giants, the telecoms, the Irvings, the Westons; in Canada, these  groups and peopleare untouchable. I do think Poilievre will be better for the economy because he'll be better at reducing housing costs and forcing municipalities to build, and will probably reduce immigration at least somewhat, putting less strain on housing, but luckily  for him, he's running against an NDP which is regarded and the Liberals, who are the oligarchs. So this one's a wash. \n\nAnyways, even I am not super excited about him, but I'm not impressed because I think he isn't conservative enough, not because he is too conservative. I do think he's smarter and more competent than Trudeau, and I'm cautiously optimistic about him. Please discuss.

Absolutely. But so is CDL, welding, plumbing, HVAC installation and those jobs are far more demanding physically. \n\nDoes the job require qualifications in degrees and intelligence? Sure, but I wager that mechanical/civil engineers, on average, are higher in test scores, GPA, and IQ score.

No. And the constant moaning and whining will only make the society disrespect them more when the rest of us cannot dream of a pension this generous with high job security.

Whether they’re running from explosions, solving murders, or just having a deep, introspective conversation, there’s *always* a bottle of water in the scene.\n\nCoincidence?

It's a big reason why lots of people actually choose to be waiters or servers instead of choosing to be a different profession.\n\nObviously, some people tip more than others, and some people don't tip at all.

If you don't tip, then they won't be able to pay their bills!\"\n\nIf that's actually true, then they would have already lost their power and water a long time ago. Plenty of customers don't tip. Plenty of servers are still able to pay their bills anyway despite that fact.\n\nIt's not your responsibility as the customer to make sure that the waiter can pay his bills. It's the waiter's responsibility to make sure that he pays his own bills.\n\n\"If you can't afford to tip, then don't go out to eat!\"\n\nThe premise of this argument is the false belief that servers are entitled to tips and that customers must tip. If you reject that false belief, you should also reject this argument. Servers and waiters are just as obligated to serve the customers that don't tip as they are to serve the customers that do tip. If you can't afford to tip, then don't tip. Don't feel bad about it either.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBy pretending like tipping is some kind of moral obligation, and feeling like you must tip every single time, you are simply playing into what the servers want. Tipping is not simply an additional benefit for the servers and for the waiters. No, it is a tool for the customers to use to their advantage.\n\nIf your server does their job properly, then feel free to tip them, if you want to do so. If your server does their job poorly, then don't hesitate to withhold the tip. Servers are not entitled to tips, they must earn them.\n\nThe real benefit of tipping culture is the power that it gives to the customer. As a customer, you have the power to decide how much your server gets paid. Don't give up that power. The worst thing to do, in my opinion, is to just tip a fixed percentage (like 15 or 20 percent) no matter how well the server did. It completely defeats the purpose of tipping, which is to put the customer in the driver's seat.", "id": 499, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hsw9yl/everyone_should_just_tip_as_much_or_as_little_as/", "time": "2025-05-06"}

As someone who grew up a total introvert with zero social skills, working a customer service position helped me grow as a person and learn skills beneficial to my future. I love working with people and I find joy in making people's day just a little bit brighter. \n\nHere is where the controversial (unpopular opinion) comes in:\n\nWhile I understand that there may not be other available options, or someone is a provider and working retail/customer service is the only option for them at the moment.... I see so much online discourse about the annoyance, displeasure, and borderline outright hatred some people have for their customers.\n\nCustomers can be rude, aggressive, entitled, etc. I fully acknowledge the validity of this. And I also acknowledge how much easier it is to get hung up on bad experiences than it is to reminisce in the good ones. \n\nThe most you can do for these people is show compassion and move on. They are having a bad day and want to ruin mine? Not happening. \"Have a nice day!\" And move on. I treat everyone with the same kindness. \n\nI don't understand why people who work retail/food service/customer service do so when they don't enjoy it. My favorite part about my job was  working with people. My customer interaction was my absolute favorite and I could come into work and a bad mood and being around people just immediately made me feel better. \n\nMy favorite thing to say to someone who gets irritated with someone who doesn't know where something is and they've just walked past it or doesn't know what they want to order immediately: They don't work there. They don't know the store or the menu like you do because you go there every day.\n\nI just think that the effort people put into their job could be spent elsewhere, preferably some place they'd be happy and finding meaning in their job. I found my meaning in human interactions. I think everyone can find their meaning, they just have to look for the right outlet. \n\nAnd just to be fair, I have complained about customers before. It's in my post history. But to write off ones job, and the whole community of people they deal with as being insufferable is something I cannot agree with. \n\nIf you have the ability, do something that makes you happy, not something that you dread waking up for in the morning. \n\nThanks for listening:)\n\n", "id": 500, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1ht4686/working_retailfood_servicecustomer_service_should/", "time": "2025-02-03"}

{"title": "The spread of misinformation is a consequence of telling people to think for themselves.", "article": "Premise 1: There is no such thing as domain-independent critical thinking skills.\n\nWhat this means is that you cannot think critically about something you know nothing about. I, for example, cannot think critically about the anthropology and origins of the Australian Aboriginals, because I know nothing about them. Are they related to the Sami people? Are they the same as Pepolonesion, however you spell that? I don't know. \n\nSimilarly, I can't think critically about the things we were given in needles around 2021-2022. I know nothing about the science of them and I'm not a doctor. So, I have to trust authorities about them, and that's why I took them. I shouldn't think critically about them.\n\nPremise 2: If you don't have the domain-specific knowledge, you shouldn't think critically within that domain.  \n  \nFor example, if you don't know the science of astronomy and planets, you shouldn't think critically about the shape of the world, because you'll probably come to the wrong conclusion if you rely on your own experience. If I look outside, and base my cosmology on what I can personally experience, the world looks pretty flat most of the time. I would end up coming to the wrong conclusion. I shouldn't think for myself on this issue.\n\nPremise 3: When we ask people to think for themselves about things they don't have the requisite knowledge of, many will naturally come to the wrong conclusions. \n\nWhen you say something, for example, such as \"trust the science\" or \"I believe in Science\", you are really saying \"I believe in the authorities which taught me facts about the world\" unless you are actually a scientist engaging in the field at an academic level, which you are probably not. \n\nWhen combined with actual skepticism of authority, you will get people who will think for themselves, and then will not know how to distinguish between the most basic facts of a certain issue, especially when it comes to an issue such as planetary cosmology.\n\nThink about it - you can't actually observe the curvature of the earth on your own. Neither can you see the curvature or orbit of other planets. Neither can you go anywhere near a star and observe that it is made of gas and isn't simply a CD underwater (there are people who believe this). So, if you think critically within this domain, and don't trust what you were taught in school, or the authorities who decided what you were going to be taught, you're going to go to people with....other ideas. Yes, I know the Greeks found the earth was round and it's curvature and radius, but you won't necessarily be that good at math.\n\nSo, in other words, you probably shouldn't think for yourself, because you can't, in most situations.\n\nPS: I believe the earth is in fact round, in case you were starting to wonder.

Just how useful their deaths are to me.\n\nMy first instinct upon breaking news of a tragedy is to scour every source I can to find, searching for some indicator of the perpetrator's raice, religion, political tribe, and/or nationality. If any indicator suggests even the most remote possibility of the perpetrator belong to an enemy group along any of these dimensions, I claim victory and gloat my heart out.

If I turn out to later be wrong about the perpetrator's identity, I refuse to issue a retraction and instead just find another line of attack.\n\nIf the tragedy is one that does not have a perpetrator, I look for ways to indirectly blame my enemies. This is a lot easier than it sounds. Everything correlates with everything, so it is not hard to find some set of correlations that allows me to connect the devastation of the tragedy with some action on the part of my enemies. Most of these are a stretch, but that does not matter, so long as people buy it. It also helps to just outright lie.

In reality, most people with low self-esteem don't do this and simply have unrealistically negative opinions about themselves in their own head, without voicing them - in fact, if their self-esteem is the lowest, it means they're unlikely to voice them, because they fully believe the negative opinions are true. Ironically, the validation-seeking reddit thinks of as \"low self-esteem\" is indicative of higher self-esteem than staying silent about negative self-perception, because their self-esteem has to be high enough to believe there's even a chance of their insecurities being stated to be incorrect (ie \"am I ugly/annoying/stupid?\" they probably have low self-esteem, but they'll usually only ask this if their self-esteem is high enough to believe the answer could potentially be \"no\". If they think there's a 0% chance of the answer being \"no\", they won't both asking).\n\nThe failure to realise the above and to think that low self-esteem only exists when it's vocalised shows that most redditors have exceptionally low emotional intelligence - because if they didn't, they'd know there's a difference between what they see on the surface and people's inner thoughts. It's the same as redditor's believing that confidence is doing behaviours that look confident, rather than actual inner confidence (where someone might not give a monkeys about \"acting confident\").\n\nReddit is fucking up the definition of words by misinterpreting them. Self-esteem is what someone feels inside, not what they do on the outside. Same for confidence. Social media's already fucked up other words like \"anxiety\", \"panic attack\", \"entitlement\", \"literally\", \"nice\" and \"abuse\". These words have all had their understood meaning changed, in some cases words that were high resolution/precise have become lower resolution due to misuse (this is why schools and parents need to teach people to stay humble enough to try to only use words correctly.

Despite this being a fallacy (a false notion), I personally believe it to be gospel throughout human history. Thus I plan on taking no action, as that would entail personal sacrifice in pursuit of a lost cause.  ", "id": 539, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hr9eqk/most_people_will_do_nothing_to_combat_climate/", "time": "2025-01-29"}

They're not only responsible for the learning and education of hundreds of adolescents per year, they're also babysitters who have an implicit goal of trying to mold how someone functions in society in a way that's beneficial. I don't think its an exaggeration to say that outside of your family, these high school teachers are the most influential adults in your life as an adolescent. They're the adults you spend the most time around in your teens, they're the ones who serve as the mentors in athletic/education pursuits, and often times they are the ones who serve as a guide on your first steps on finding out who you want to be.\n\nDespite this, many teachers are predatory weirdos and bottom of the barrel rejects. The ones who aren't are often overworked, overwhelmed, and underpaid to the point that I can only assume they're masochists for choosing the job. The job is not looked upon respectfully by society no matter what lip service is paid by celebrities and politicians. Schools are more concerned with getting a warm body to stand in a classroom than having someone qualified teach. The district overstuffs classrooms to the point of absurdity and shuffles around known bad apples to different areas because they don't have enough teachers. Why? Because being a teacher is a shit job and we as a society don't value it despite its importance.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to me that such an important job is filled with so many unqualified and dangerous hacks and the ones who are qualified are usually treated like shit. My proposed change would be to make high school teaching an actually prestigious job instead of it being seen as borderline bum job it is now. Maybe these steps could server as a start.\n\n1. Higher pay - Pretty self explanatory, teachers are paid like shit. They should be getting paid much more. In return it should be a job that requires a lot of qualification and impeccable behavior. Being a teacher should be something to aspire to because you are paid and treated well.\n2. Stricter Requirements - With more pay, more is required. Stricter background checks on teachers and stricter rules on their conduct. I've seen too many suspect teachers skirt around. We should've be having Joe Schmo be responsible for 100s of kids every year.\n3. Stricter monitoring - This applies to both students and teachers. The behaviors of both should be held to a higher standard than what we have today.

But more to the point, the work is often a lot more abstract, and the impact is often less clear.\n\nSo, people in corporate jobs may often feel that things need to be mandated by the federal government, because it's this prescribed \"work 40 hours a week with a very inflexible schedule, doing work where the impact isn't super obvious.\"\n\nLess people should go to college. We should structure society to be more of a meritocracy; part of the problem is that we are NOT a meritocracy nearly to the degree that we should be.

I don't think they're available in my country (AND I AM SO JEALOUS!) but I see the positive effect they've had on people online and the second I have an opportunity I am grabbing it. I'm 21 and within the last 5 years I've gained and last over 5-15kg all throughout each year. Gain and lose, gain and lose.

Weight loss and gain is just so mentally taxing and I'm sick of it. I know I'm not the only one who's experienced this: having their mind be mentally taxed because of food and weight. I literally missed new year's celebrations with my friends just so I could binge eat. My happiest highs in life consist of getting off on food and then having to lie to people about why I didn't show up and what I was really doing (which was bingeing lol). \n\nThe fact that people do not think about their weight ever because they don't obsess over food and have an addiction is crazy to me. \n\nThe fact that there's a drug that opens people up to this experience is amazing.

But lemme just share my opinion/experience\n\nFirst of all: THIS IS ALL ABOUT FRIENDSHIP/CONNECTIONS. NOT ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS NOR FEELINGS. IF YOU CAN'T APPROACH A FRIENDSHIP OR CONNECTION WITHOUT ASSUMING SOMETHING ELSE, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU, AND I'M GENUINELY SORRY FOR YOU\n\nI'm 17. I've been in both situations. I've always had friends both older and younger than me. People my age have been consistently hard to befriend, because in my opinion most of seem too shallow. I'm going to break it down by categories, for simplicity's sake:\n\nFirst, people older than me. Since I was little, I've always been interested in stuff, mainly science, that was way beyond my age. All about atoms and cells at 5; space, geology and geometry at 7/8, etc. While my classmates were playing tag or whatever, I was chatting with the substitute teachers about random fun facts from stuff I'd learned. This is what you can POSSIBLY have in common with a kid. I felt way more comfortable/confident with them than I did with my classmates, which would never listen to me or take me seriously.\n\nAs I grew older, the age with which I felt confident around started diminishing, but eventually I had 3 or 4 close friends that were 3-6 years older than me. These friendships were incredibly important in my life. I had some really good people to look up to.\n\n\n\nMy grandma always tells me that teaching is the best way to learn. Nowhere is that more apparent than in spending time with younger people/kids. I get to be that boy they look up to, and I get to know myself better and be more comfortable with myself\n\nMy cousins are 14 and 11. They're the closest people to me after my immediate family. I know people will say \"WELL IT DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUR FAMILY. Ok, some of my friends from my immediate friend group are also 12/13, and I'm close with them. How is that weird?\n\nThe amount of assumptions and projections that arise from these kinds of stories are genuinely worrying. I'm not saying that the concept of maturity is relative, which is NOT, but that shouldn't dictate the stuff that you can/can't have in common as much as overall boundaries should, obviously set by both the younger and the older persons. They should also be taught more thoroughly by parents. Another example:\n\nIn a family camp I went to last year, I met a girl about 8 which started talking to me and stuff, and we kinda became \"friends\" for the remainder of the camp. What was I supposed to do, ignore her?\n\nJust be careful and you're good, for example, I refused to tickle her when she asked me, just because I didn't feel comfortable touching her, and it was not a good lesson for her. That's a boundary that a kid might not respect, but it's inalienable\n\nWhen they saw her with me, no one batted an eye. Hell, I was talking with her mother while holding her, and she even smiled.\n\nSo yeah, that should be the norm. Doesn't matter if they're older or younger, as long as it's a genuine connection without anything else, and you set proper boundaries, you're good to go.\n\nIf you don't see it like this, I'm genuinely curious as to why, so feel free to discuss\n\n:)", "id": 576, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hqqgb5/age_isntshouldnt_be_a_barrier_in_friendship_and/", "time": "2024-12-08"}

{"title": "Immigration is a good thing", "article": "I've been seeing a lot of nativist rhetoric on reddit ever since Elon and Vivek came out in support of H1Bs, and I figured I should do something about it. At it's core, most of the arguments for restricting H1-Bs or other forms of immigration are protectionist in nature.\n\nImmigration is a good thing because:\n\n\\-they aren't actually taking jobs.\n\n\\-it leads to a more robust economy.\n\n\\-long term American birth rate decline leading to decreased tax base and looming employee shortage.\n\nEconomists have come up with the term \"[lump of labor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lump-of-labour-fallacy.asp)\" fallacy to describe concerns about immigrants taking jobs. The starting assumption for people who make this fallacy is that there is a fixed number of jobs and allowing other people to take those jobs hurts American workers.\n\nThe reality is that the number of jobs are dynamic, and based on laws of supply and demand. Jobs are created and destroyed, but positive displacement occurs when sectors become more efficient and spur greater specialization.\n\nCounterintuitively, economists have [repeatedly](https://www.mercatus.org/research/policy-briefs/unintended-consequences-restrictions-h-1b-visas) [observed](https://www.cato.org/publications/research-briefs-economic-policy/how-do-restrictions-high-skilled-immigration-affect) positive impacts from immigration.\n\nHow can this be? The primary explanation for this has been that:\n\n>high-skilled foreign workers are complements for American workers, which means that companies have some roles that they cannot fill with American workers and others that can be filled by American workers. That is, American high-skilled workers and foreign high-skilled workers may possess different skillsets that are effective when combined together. For example, to create an artificial intelligence robotics department, a company might require a highly specialized skillset that it cannot find in the United States, so it hires a foreign worker to lead the department. However, the department needs additional workers to be on the team, and these are filled by American workers. This means that when a company cannot hire high-skilled foreign workers to create the department, then the additional department jobs for Americans workers are also lost.\n\nWhat actually happens with increased immigration restrictions is that companies decide to offshore, and simply go directly to other countries to find the hires they want instead of attracting immigrants to the states. With less immigration restrictions, the long term shows greater job creation and increased productivity.\n\nBesides bring labor, immigrants bring exchange of goods and services with them and this is relevant to the next point.\n\nSeveral states are [currently facing low birth rates and will have a decreased tax base](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2022/12/the-long-term-decline-in-fertility-and-what-it-means-for-state-budgets) as a result. Simply put, a critical mass of people is needed to maintain a society and ensure that ample goods and services are provided.\n\nThat is where immigrants can come in. Immigrants don't just work, they also have to spend money on housing, food, gas, cars, clothing, etc. This also spurs economic activity.\n\nThey also pay taxes, and they can't immediately access social services. To see a practical example of how immigration helped with a population deficit, one can simply look at how [successful Singapore](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/cato-working-paper-53-update.pdf) is.\n\nSome of the above arguments, especially to those in tech, may fall flat because of layoffs. The thinking is that if there is currently an oversupply of labor, why bring in more people?\n\nTo see how ruinous this thinking be, we can look at medicine. I am simplifying the story here, but about 30 years ago there was predicted to be an oversupply of doctors. The medical field intervened, and increased the barriers to entry to try to protect physician wages.\n\nAmong many other protectionist measures in the medical field, one of those barriers entry remains how difficult it is for international medical graduates to work in the US. People who have already been trained and are competent doctors and do not need money invested in them to start contributing to the economy, often end up having to pursue allied health professions and are shut out of being doctors entirely.\n\nIn the short term, doctors succeeded. They command high wages, but this had negative consequences down the line. Today, restrictive immigration practices are one of many reasons contributing to a physician shortage. The physician shortage has wide ranging effects and looks like increased burnout, greater patient uncertainty as to when they get their next appointment, increased costs, decreased access to care for rural patients, and a general muted productivity in medicine as to what it could be.\n\nHopefully, this post addresses a lot of the arguments made on reddit.\n\n ", "id": 581, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hrccvl/immigration_is_a_good_thing/", "time": "2025-03-21"}

In essence they are asked to put aside their religious values in the realm of politics. The problem is, religion is an axiomatic value. Axiomatic values are the thing that supersedes all other values or to put it another way it's a first principle. These are the values that undergird all others. Here's an example of a non religious axiom. \n\nPerson A: \"I support free trade\", \nPerson B: \"why?\"\n\nPerson A \"I think it's the most efficient way to allocate resources.\" \nPerson B: \"why do you care about that?\" \n\nPerson A: \"the efficient allocation of resources makes people wealthier\" \nPerson B: \"why do you care about that?\" \n\nPerson A: \"I think people are happier when they have money\". \nPerson B:  \"why do you care about that?\" \n\nPerson A: \"I think it's good when people are as happy as possible\"\nPerson B: \"why?\" \n\nPerson A: \"happiness is good\"\nPerson B: \"why?\"\n\nPerson A: \"umm....\"\n\nPerson A has an axiom which is that happiness is good.

{"title": "You have some level of obligation to everybody. ", "article": "A common opinion or maxim on Reddit is that \"you don't owe that person anything\". This person varies, but often it goes as far as someone's parents or close relatives (except children). Hilariously, one discussion I saw today was how retail workers shouldn't have to tell customers their names because they don't owe them that information. Lol. Today's wisdom is that we are disconnected, autonomous islands, with no responsibilities towards others if we don't voluntarily take them on.\n\nI believe this is wrong in a cosmological sense and is a society-destroying if actually enacted. You can't have a society in which there are no social obligations between people. We already have that substantiated in law, but outside of legal matters it's important as well. For example, you may be able to tell I'm going through online dating, and the ghosting we have in today's age is a point of consternation for me and for many. I think this is due to a breakdown in how we see social responsibility. If you really don't have any obligation to anyone, then ghosting is totally fine...but we all know literally nobody likes it. So, if you don't want to see someone, you probably have some level of obligation to say so, **Provided they gave you the initial respect that you should receive as a human by at least showing politeness and obeying whatever the social norms are for online dating.**\n\nBecause I don't want this to be about just online dating, there are posts on reddit, typically the relationship focused ones, about cutting people off, including parents, and people will cut off parents for basically no reason, and the comments are often like \"Yeah! F those guys! You don't owe your parents shit!\". Well, no. You don't owe your parents the world, you can't pay them back for your food and education as a child, and they can't ask for that in any reasonable world, but if you're going to cut your parents off, you'd better have a good reason. \n\nThe reason I say everyone is that, for a society to function, there has to be some guarantee of mutual respect, and I think that has to go beyond \"leaving people alone\". Yes, in most cases you should leave people to their business. But as a Christian, I can't see street people and think \"Eh, not my business\". We owe them something as a society, even if they are strangers. \n\nI propose this: For a society to function, **respect is something** ***owed by you*****, to others.** Yes, it is still conditional, but it is not earned.\n\nPlease discuss.

{"title": "There is no point in taxing the rich", "article": "A common line we see on the left is \"tax the rich!\"  Implying that the rich do not pay their fair share in taxes and by taxing them more extensively we could fund the government better. However I disagree.  Not because the sentiment is bad, but because there is no point in taxing the rich because the math just doesn't work out.\n\nSo, let's do some math.  There are currently 801 billionaires in the US.  This represents 28.8% of all billionaires in the world, a substantial number given that the US only makes up 4.2% of the worlds population.  The 801 billionaires have a combined net worth of 6.22 trillion.  And because I'm not screwing around, let's seize all their assets.  All 6.22 trillion of them.\n\nThat is enough money to fund the US government for roughly 1.05 years.  That's it.  The US Government spends 6 trillion per year currently (and keep in mind this number historically has only been going up).  So in exchange of removing all billionaires from society (and scaring off literally every single wealthy person by doing so (need some evidence?  Look at the rate of capital flight from the UK over the past decade)), you managed to fund the government for just over a year.  Wow.  Good job.  And this is assuming you somehow not only manage to get this passed but also manage to successfully seize all their assets, which is in stocks, bonds, companies, cash, overseas accounts, real estate, and more.\n\nThere isn't any point to it.  The US spends too much.

Same goes for the popular movement to redesignate Columbus Day as \"Indigenous People's Day\".\n\nI have no problem with renaming buildings and things that were previously named for historical figures who did horrible things.  While the people being honored by the new names are certainly deserving of the honor, such a big 180-degree flip on the name where the new honoree is the exact opposite of the original honoree makes me think that the institution only honored them in order to make a statement about the original names, and that they didn't view them as worthy of honor in their own right by having their names placed on either a new building or place, or something that had previously been unnamed, and the existing building's being renamed for something completely unrelated.  In other words, the new honorees are being shortchanged by being a convenient way to dispose of an undesired name, and are second-best by only being chosen for the honor after bad people were removed.\n\nSame goes for the Columbus Day/Indigenous People's Day debate.

If you want to designate a holiday for indigenous people, great - create a new holiday on a new date, and eliminate the old holiday as a separate thing.\n\nIn other words, if someone is as worthy of an honor as you think, give them the full honor by placing their name on something new, and not as an obvious reaction to a bad name.", "id": 620, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hptlgr/the_honorees_of_renamed_buildings_and_other/", "time": "2024-10-28"}

", "article": "Apologies for the tired subject but I felt like I wanted to put this thought into words somewhere. \n\nOftentimes I get the impression that other pro choice advocates either don't want to talk about this at all or significantly downplay its impact. We have to be honest with not only those who disagree but also ourselves. \n\nFirstly, I'm a dude, so my scope is obviously limited by that factor. However, an abortion is ultimately a procedure to remove a thing that will eventually become a human being, and further, somebody's child. It is absolutely not out of the question in my view that even if a woman determines abortion is the right decision and something that is not immoral, there may be still some sense of connection and a sense of loss, shame or grief that can be experienced from losing that connection, both internally and externally from society. Pregnancy and birth are things that are highly regarded and respected universally by basically all human beings, and the body begins the production of influential hormones as soon as implantation occurs. This can be a very difficult time emotionally for a lot of people, and we shouldn't be afraid of respecting and addressing that. It may feel like ceding ground to the pro life side, but it's actually one less gotcha in their toolbelt when debates occur. \n\nAdditionally, abortion is a somewhat invasive medical procedure that can be very uncomfortable physically, and poses risks like any other procedure. From another psychological end, it's a whole drive to some clinic you might not have even been to before, it can be quite expensive, and there's probably a bunch of weird creeps screaming at you and holding signs plastered with medical gore in your face. However, and my experience here is extremely limited but to my knowledge/limited experience, I have never heard anything bad about the staff at these clinics. In basically every instance I've heard of and experienced, these people are immensely supportive, empathetic, willing to work with you on the financial side, and very professional. \n\nI don't want to knock the clinics themselves at all, especially given all the other immensely important services places like Planned Parenthood provides. But still, even if you trust your surgeon, going into surgery can be an emotionally daunting proposition and can be kinda scary because it's so infrequent for most people, and I don't see why the same wouldn't be true for an abortion.

{"title": "Life in solitary confinement is a better punishment than death penalty", "article": "Death penalty is both extremely cruel and extremely lenient in my opinion. It is cruel to those who have ended up on a false conviction as you can not reverse a decision once the falsely convicted has been executed and lenient for people who actually commited a horrible crime. If you end up doing a crime that warrants a death penalty then clearly it did not deter you enough. And besides, horrible criminals show no mercy and would not care if they were executed.\n\nWhich is why life in solitary confinement is a more suitable punishment for the worst of crimes. Not just any solitary confinement though, It has to be a white room with padding all around so they don't hurt themselves, lights on 24/7, soundproof room, white clothing, white bland food and nothing inside. basically anything to completely deprive their senses. It is lenient because at the very least if you are falsely convicted, You have a chance to get out and it is suitable for a punishment for actual criminals as they get to feel the consequences for their actions without them actually getting physically hurt in the process.\n\n\"But the CIA does that to interrogate people!

{"title": "Part of the reason why women are so disappointed with modern dating is because way women evaluate men doesn't work for selecting an equal relationship.", "article": "This may be confusing, and I don't mean to paint women here with an overly large brush, but some generalizing is necessary. I'll establish the points, which I believe will be mostly agreed upon. We'll start by saying that I'm talking about women seeking men. \n\n1. Women looking for men nowadays find the men they do find disappointing often. You will see \"the bar is on the floor for men\" stated often, by a certain type of person. This may be because of points 2 and 3, which are:\n\n2. Women are desiring more equal relationships than in years past where the income and household work splits are closer to 50/50.\n\n3. Women are still seeking men that will make firm relationship commitments to them. This means monogamy (except where it doesn't, but we aren't talking about those people), and men who will define the relationship firmly, without unnecessary ambiguities. We're talking about women looking for marriage here, at least eventually, which is still a lot of women. \n\n4. Outside of those things, women still want a man who is handsome, has good social skills, dresses well, is in good shape, and earns a strong income, has career drive and ambition, and wants to take care of her, all other things being equal. I may get pushback on the \"takes care of her\" point, but I think many will still find this to be true.\n\n5. Women like it when a man takes charge in the early stages of a relationship, which means asking the woman out, setting the dates, paying for them, and other things. The thing which made my thoughts click is when I saw one woman on online dating say \"Bonus points for you if you can tell me how to dress on our first date\".\n\nI haven't written it out in enough detail to state it simply enough, but I believe what I've come to understand is that women find disappointment because the things they look for in men don't translate to equal relationships. \n\nIn other words, point 1 is basically in contradiction with points 2 through 5. Take the last example I gave in point 5. Having a man tell you how to dress for your first date is pretty patriarchal, no? If you're asking for that, you are telegraphing a patriarchal relationship, and you are selecting for men who will want a more patriarchal relationship. Having a man plan things out for you and pay is 1). telegraphing that you want a man to be in charge of you, and 2), telegraphing that you are an \"item\" that needs to be paid for.\n\nOn point 4, there are a few things. A guy with better social skills will be more socially dominant and less likely to take on the woman's traditional roles in a relationship. A guy with more income will be more focused on his job and will be less inclined to do housework. Additionally, men used to be able to dress well because they had stronger male role models who told them how to dress. If you want less male dominance in society, you would have to accept that there would be fewer male role models around to morph men into the man you would want them to be, and you'll have to take on more of the responsibility. This is admittedly my weakest point. \n\nOn point 3, one of the things which has remained from patriarchy the hardest and which seems to want to go away the least is that the man defines the relationship status, once the woman lets there be one, of course. Think about this; the one thing that the man still pretty much *always* does in a relationship, even now, is be the one to ask the woman to marry him. Feminism has changed much, but it doesn't seem to have changed this. If it's the man's responsibility to do the asking, that puts the power in the man's hands to define the relationship, which is pretty patriarchal.\n\nI'm getting long winded at this point. I think I've figured out a simpler way to state it; as long as you, as a woman, are seeking a relatively modern relationship, but are using the tenets of more traditional masculinity to find a man for that relationship, you are in conflict. \n\nThis has also helped me realize that part of the animosity between men and women is that the statement \"The bar is on the floor for guys\" is sort of true...once the guy is in the relationship. It's definitely not true for  guys who aren't in a relationship already. \n\nINB4:\n\nNo, I am not an i-word.  \nNo, this does not justify i-word rhetoric.  \nNo, this does not justify hating women (or men, for that matter).   \nNo, I am not saying that women should go back to the kitchen, or that we should go back to the 1950's or before.   \nNo, men are not trash.  \nNo, women are not trash.  \nNo, I am not saying you as a woman personally want patriarchy. I am saying that many of the things you may want in a man or in a relationship may be vestiges of patriarchy.   \nNo, I am not saying patricarchy is good.\n\n  \nThank you all and Happy New Year.", "id": 688, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hnu3wy/part_of_the_reason_why_women_are_so_disappointed/", "time": "2024-08-27"}

Even niche subreddits—places meant to focus on specific hobbies, interests, or critical thinking—are tainted by off-topic political posts because moderators refuse to enforce their own rules. If a subreddit can’t maintain its intended purpose, it shouldn’t exist in its current form.\n\nEvery subreddit seems destined to fall into the same trap. No matter the topic—be it skepticism, joe Rogan, or gardening—someone inevitably posts an inflammatory political take that has no place in the community. And when moderators turn a blind eye, these posts become normalized. Instead of thoughtful discussions or niche expertise, the subreddit turns into yet another battleground for partisan shouting matches and links to partisan news articles.\n\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t about censorship or saying politics doesn’t matter. It’s about maintaining the integrity of spaces dedicated to other things. Political content might belong in subreddits designed for it, but when it invades unrelated communities, it derails conversations, drives away users, and erodes the quality of the platform.\n\nI can already hear someone furiously typing, “Everything is political!” And you know what? You’re not wrong. If someone wants to discuss how the current economy is affecting camping supplies in a camping forum, that’s completely understandable and even relevant. But let’s be honest—that’s not what actually happens.\n\nInstead, half the site ends up recycling the same worn-out jokes, memes, and takes that boil down to little more than, “The other team is bad.” It’s lazy, it’s off-topic, and it adds nothing to the discussion. These posts don’t contribute to the subreddit’s intended purpose; they just turn it into yet another echo chamber for partisan sniping.\n\nHere’s a simple solution:\n\t1.\tIf moderators consistently fail to enforce their own subreddit’s rules—especially against irrelevant political content—they should lose their ownership.\n\t2.\tOwnership should pass to active, responsible moderators, or the subreddit should be archived entirely.\n\t3.\tThis would force moderators to take their responsibilities seriously, ensuring subreddits remain focused on their original purpose and not yet another soapbox for political arguments.\n\nThis issue isn’t just annoying; it’s a rot that spreads across Reddit. The more subreddits allow themselves to be hijacked by off-topic political content, the more the platform as a whole loses its value as a space for diverse, topic-focused communities. If a subreddit can’t uphold its rules and protect its identity, it’s time for Reddit to step in.\n\nYes, this opinion might rub some people the wrong way, but subreddits are supposed to be about fostering community, not turning every discussion into the same exhausting, never-ending political argument.

And guess what? It’s pissing off all those pretentious artists who think their “process” is more important than the actual result. Newsflash: nobody cares how many hours you spent crying over your canvas if an AI can create something ten times better in five minutes.\n\nThe funniest part? These artists are so delusional they’re out here crying about some made-up \"soul\" nonsense, as if art needs to have magical fairy dust sprinkled on it to be valid. Spoiler alert: art is about what you feel when you see it, not how much the creator suffered for it. Half the “art” hanging in galleries already feels soulless anyway, so spare us the dramatics.\n\nThey also whine about AI \"stealing\" from them, but let’s not pretend humans haven’t been ripping each other off for centuries. Every artist is inspired by someone else—it’s how creativity works. AI is just doing the same thing, but faster and without the whining.\n\nSo yeah, AI art is better. It’s faster, cooler, and way more accessible. And the fact that it’s flipping the art world on its head? That’s just the cherry on top. If you’re one of those snobby artists who’s mad about it—good. Maybe it’s time you got off your high horse and joined the rest of us in the real world.\n\nCry harder. AI isn’t going anywhere. And hey, maybe next time it’ll tape a virtual banana to a wall and call it art. At least *that* wouldn’t cost $120,000.", "id": 701, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1horqy3/ai_art_is_better_than_human_art/", "time": "2025-05-21"}
{"title": "\"Good people\" Don't exist ", "article": "You know, this whole idea that there are \"good people\" out there is total nonsense. It’s comforting, sure, but that doesn’t make it true. The truth is, everyone’s messed up in their own way. The \"good people\" we hear about? They’re just the ones who have convinced themselves they’re different. But dig a little deeper, and they’re just as selfish, petty, and self-serving as everyone else.\n\nTake those people who are always talking about how they \"just want to help others.\" Yeah, they *might* do some nice things, but half the time, they do it because it makes them feel good about themselves or gives them some social points. If you think they're doing it purely out of kindness, you’re kidding yourself. Everybody wants something in return, even if it's just the warm, fuzzy feeling of thinking they’re a \"good person.\" Most people will put on a mask, but take it off, and they’re just looking out for #1.\n\nEven the ones who claim to have \"good intentions\" or are always preaching about love and peace? They’re usually the most judgmental. They won’t hesitate to tear down someone they think is “less than” or \"not good enough.\" And let’s not even get started on those who say they don’t care about money, fame, or status. Yeah, okay. We all care. Everyone cares. It's hardwired into us. No one's above it.\n\nAnd don’t even talk about the \"heroes\" of the world—the ones who save lives, donate to charities, whatever. They’ve got their own dark corners. No one’s perfect. People are so damn quick to judge others for being selfish, but then they turn around and make excuses for their own bad behavior. Everyone’s just hiding behind some version of \"I'm a good person, I promise.\" But if you really look closely, you’ll see the cracks. You’ll see their flaws.\n\nAt the end of the day, we’re all just out here trying to survive, and in that process, we screw people over without even thinking about it sometimes. So, yeah, \"good people\"? They don’t exist.

At a faster rate than the people who are entering the work force.\n\nSo this will mean that we have to generate more money for the ageing retirees' benefits from a decreasing workforce which leads to higher and higher taxes on the working class making it unbearable for young working people to live their own lives with upward  financial movement.\n\nAnd because of the falling birth rate, it'll mean the old people are the bigger voting bloc and will force politicians to cater to their s even at young people's expense so policies that I crease tax to fund welfare will get passed.\n\nThis will lead the young working to have even less kids because they'll be overworked and the negative feedback looks will be sealed.\n\nThere are 3 solutions to this, both suck for somebody :\n\n1. Reduce the rate of people who qualify for welfare benefits by rasing the retirement age so that more peopne keep working and your system isn't strained as much.\n2. .Abolish the Retirement  SSI Sytem or reduce the number of benefits it contains for retirees so that everyone has to keep working for themselves and those that retire aren't a big  burden on the government and the young working class gets taxed less..really everyone gets taxed less here.\n3. Increase the number of people entering the work force via immigration or increasing the birth rates. Immigration is a stop gap solution that doesn't work in the long term since 2nd generation Americans follow the same birth tends as 3rd+ gen Americans.\n\nThe only way to increase the birth rate with current technology is to regulate abortion and birth control access. Advanced capitalistic nations in Scandinavia have tried all kinds of state birth incentives that failed. The only way to make people have mkre kids is to narrow the gap between sex frequency and pregnancy frequency. This obviously sucks for women mostly\n\nSo of these 3 solutions,No 1 is the  best.\n\nIt doesn't  surpress women's reproductive rights like no.3 orleave...and unlike no 2, it doesn't remove welfare service availability...it just increases the entry age which is okay since we have longer life spans than ever.\n\nWhat do you think?", "id": 728, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hnt571/conservatives_are_right_about_the_social_security/", "time": "2025-03-13"}

If you've actually played the game you know she's just a psychotic, lunatic, crazed killer doing whatever she wants and causing as much chaos and mayhem as she wants. That's it. The only extra lore bits is that she has an even crazier sister. We despise Arcane and everything it stands for. It's flawed from the concept. I despise Arcane because it's another example of people having to make every villain \" UWU I'M SYMPATHIC FEEL BAD FOR MEEE! \", and it's so extremely tiring. What happened to characters just being crazy or chaos loving for the sake of it? Jinx was Riot's version of Harley Quinn. And she worked. Simple, crazy, and that's it, nothing else needed. But now she can't be seen as anything other than the giant shadow the series casts on her. Not to mention the people that watch Arcane stay far away from League, further disrespecting the source material and  not understanding the character at all. It's the over complicating of everything, it's the bastardization of everything. People love the Joker because he's just that, an embodiment of chaos, anarchy, and mayhem. He causes destruction just because he wants to see the world burn. We don't have a whole ass game focused on how he became the Joker. He just is. And any development he's given is AFTER he's the Joker and it's focused on his relationship with Batman and how they both need each other to give each other purpose, it's the Yin and the Yang, it's deep and worth exploring.

So many other champions have a story genuinely worth expanding upon and exploring, but not they choose the already established and fine as is characters and give them more for no reason.

Society treats MILLIONS like shit but you don't see millions going around murdering people do you? No. So he has absolutely no excuse, especially because countless people have had it so much worse than him, so he's just a pathetic sorry excuse of a human lashing out with no justifiable reason.

That’s why it’s a convenient scapegoat for bad behavior: \"It wasn’t me, it was the propaganda!\" Or, as they used to say back in the day, \"The devil made me do it!\"\n\n\n\nMyth Two: \"I’m too smart to fall for it.\"\n\n\n\n((Laughs in psy-op)). Oh, sweetheart, no. Your arrogance makes you an easy target. All I have to do is stroke that ego of yours. Flatter you. Tell you you’re special, enlightened, smarter than \"those other idiots.\" I’ll tell you you’re on the right side of history, and they’re the bad guys. Sound familiar? You’ll eat it up because it feeds your ego, and before you know it, you’re parroting the same points I designed for you.\n\n\n\nMyth Three: \"Only those people fall for propaganda.\"\n\n\n\nNope. Everyone is susceptible to it. You, me, everyone. Why? Because propaganda is just targeted marketing. It’s tailor-made to appeal to your wants, needs, fears, and desires. You think you’re immune because you’re logical, but I’m not going after your logic—I’m going for your emotions. Because if I can get you to feel, you’ll forget to think. That’s the whole game.\n\n\nFast food ads? That’s propaganda. They don’t sell burgers; they sell happiness and family moments. ASPCA commercials? Same deal—they trigger guilt and compassion. It’s all about emotional manipulation. Even neon signs are propaganda in a way—they’re designed to catch your eye. It’s everywhere, and it works because it’s made for you.\n\n\n\nThe Truth About Propaganda:\n\n\n\nI’m not trying to convert everyone. That’s not how it works. I’m not going to turn a vegetarian into a steak lover with my steakhouse ad. But that’s fine—I’m not talking to vegetarians. I’m targeting the people who already love steak. I’m showing them sizzling steaks, happy diners, and good times. I’m tapping into their existing desires. I’ve already accounted for the people I won’t reach. What matters is getting enough of the right people to bite, and I will.\n\n\nSo no, propaganda isn’t some all-powerful force that magically rewires brains. It’s just psychology, marketing, and knowing how to push the buttons you already have. Everyone is vulnerable to it—especially those who think they aren’t.", "id": 743, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hmx381/you_all_need_to_stop_using_the_word_propaganda/", "time": "2024-12-05"}

{"title": "Reddit is a Liberal Echo Chamber", "article": "Reddit’s upvote/downvote system creates a self-reinforcing cycle that favors popular opinions, and since Reddit leans heavily liberal, it ends up becoming a liberal echo chamber. The way the system works—by summing upvotes and downvotes—means that the most \"agreeable\" comments rise to the top. If a comment doesn’t align with the predominant viewpoint, it gets buried, regardless of how well-reasoned or factual it might be.\n\nTo make things worse, Reddit’s infrastructure itself isn’t as decentralized or democratic as it seems. Did you know that **92 of the top 500 subreddits are controlled by just 4 people**? These mods wield an immense amount of power, essentially deciding what conversations can and can’t happen in massive communities like politics, worldnews, news. The implications are obvious: this concentrated control allows for a heavy bias in content moderation, often skewing towards liberal perspectives while censoring or suppressing dissenting views. It’s like a gatekeeping mechanism disguised as a free platform.\n\nNow let’s talk about how this plays out with non-liberal polarizing figures like Elon Musk. Love him or hate him, there’s no denying that Reddit has a knack for spinning anything related to him into a negative narrative. A perfect example is the controversy surrounding Starlink in Ukraine. When SpaceX provided **free** Starlink service to Ukraine, the agreement explicitly stated that it would be used for humanitarian purposes, like providing internet to hospitals and civilians, and not for military operations. However, when Ukrainian forces couldn’t use Starlink in a specific military zone for an offensive, Reddit threads were filled with accusations that Musk deliberately sabotaged Ukraine’s efforts by \"shutting down\" Starlink.\n\nThe truth? Musk didn’t “shut down” anything—SpaceX never agreed to enable Starlink in those zones in the first place. Despite this, Reddit narratives ignored these facts and painted him as someone undermining Ukraine’s war efforts. This kind of narrative framing conveniently skips over the massive humanitarian contribution Musk’s Starlink made in the region while focusing solely on a misleading spin. Redditors also speculated that Musk was Pro-Russia. It was later revealed Russia was trying to hack Ukraine's starlink systems but this was defended by SpaceX.\n\n**This isn’t about whether you support Musk or not—it’s about how the system amplifies certain viewpoints while demonizing others. When you combine the upvote/downvote mechanics with concentrated mod control, you get an echo chamber where alternative perspectives struggle to gain traction.**\n\nReddit isn’t the bastion of open discussion it pretends to be, and the sooner we acknowledge that, the better.\n\nPrediction: This post gets deleted or heavily downvoted.

{"title": "Many traits of \"emotional intelligence\" are just conditioning from a relatively privileged life experience of prior positive interpersonal experiences", "article": "I was reading Dan Goleman's book about emotional intelligence (EQ). It describes EQ as:\n\n1. *Knowing one's emotions*\n2. *Managing emotions*\n3. *Motivating oneself*\n\n*4. Recognizing emotions in others*\n\n*5. Handling relationships*\n\n**He also describes high EQ men/women as:**\n\n\\-Outgoing, cheerful, assertive, feel positive about themselves, socially poised, life holds meaning for them, adapt well to stress, express their feelings directly, not prone to fearfulness or worried rumination, sympathetic, good capacity for taking responsibility, caring in relationships.\n\n**And described low EQ men/women as:**\n\n\\-Critical, inhibited, condescending, unexpressive, detached, emotionally bland, prone to anxiety, prone to guilt, prone to rumination, hesitant to express their anger directly\n\nThe \"high EQ\" descriptors mostly sound like the result of positive previous interpersonal experiences, while the \"low EQ\" ones mostly sound like the result of negative previous interpersonal experiences. Anyone can be cheerful, assertive, feel positive about themselves, feel life has meaning and have good practice of feeling and expressing emotions, if they've been encouraged by others in the past and have a dearth of discouragment. If someone is repeatedly shamed, rejected, ridiculed, has their needs or opinions trampled on or is outright assaulted, they will not be as carefree or impassioned in life, or as well-practiced in feeling emotions or expressing emotions. Partly because they'll learn to reflexively suppress emotions due to their only emotions being painful ones and partly they'll supress their emotions and display of emotions because they need to stay safe and displaying certain emotions is not safe in their environment - but unfortunately the reality is often \"use it or lose it\" (at least temporarily).\n\nUnlike the aspects of intelligence that IQ tries to measure, the description of \"emotional intelligence\" (EQ) doesn't seem to be anything innate or even close to stable. Rather, it seems to be much more the result of a privileged upbringing or life, rather than any actual intelligence. IQ can be negatively affected by things like stress or depression, but for that we're talking about maybe a 10-15% decrease, while with EQ I'd say you could see a near-100% decrease from stress. Let's say you physically and sexually torture somebody in a prison for a few years and tell them it's what the world thinks they deserve and mock, shame or punish them for any emotional reactivity, and let's say you have their primary caregivers and family partake in it too - I think you could achieve a near 100% decrease in EQ after a while, but nowhere near the same decrease in IQ.\n\nIt would be very difficult to take a high IQ person, with innately high empathy from birth, and turn them into a low IQ person according to Goleman's description, without delivering some major physical brain damage. However, it would be quite easy to take a high EQ child or even high EQ adult, and turn them into a low EQ person, purely through harsh treatment or social rejection and without any physical brain damage.\n\nI found it a little ironic that he's calling people who are shy or have been conditioned to be emotionally closed off \"emotionally unintelligent\" - IMO this viewpoint lacks the EQ to realise that people are emotionally affected by their prior life experiences or intolerant environments or that not everyone expresses emotions or empathy in the same way, and that cultural conditioning is part of this - for example, different cultures use different amounts of verbal and non-verbal cues when talking. For example, native Japanese-speakers tend to [backchannel more frequently](https://www.reading.ac.uk/elal/-/media/project/uor-main/schools-departments/elal/lswp/lswp-3/ell_language_6_cutrone_vol_3.pdf?la=en&hash=778C39577A775742F47009ACDEAA81B3) (ie say things like \"I see\" or \"hmm\" while listening to speech) than English-speakers during conversations, whether speaking in either Japanese or English. Japanese also focus on different facial cues compare to Americans - [they focus more on the eyes, rather than the mouth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103106000321) and receive more communication via the eyes (here's a Japanese language teacher [talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MJSZn8voDo) about it).\n\n", "id": 754, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hmvb9z/many_traits_of_emotional_intelligence_are_just/", "time": "2024-11-29"}

Everyone wished me a happy new year in Cantonese; kung hey fat choy!  That included me in their celebration despite the fact I don't believe in their astrology, their lunar year is not my solar year, etc.  \n\nWhen I volunteered at a Jewish community center, I offered a Chag Sameach despite being Christian. They made me feel included despite being a gentile.\n\nIt's also more honest to say Merry Christmas because it is lost on absolutely no one that the phrase \"Happy Holidays\" disappears from use on December 26th. In most years, there are no other real holidays happening in late December. \n\nMerry 3rd day of Christmas!", "id": 763, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hnbk7i/merry_christmas_is_more_inclusive_than_happy/", "time": "2025-03-14"}

I'll give some examples.\n\nThe Economy/Government Reliability: The right also frequently mentions how the left is \"ruining the economy\" or \"wasting tax dollars\" but how true is that? The right has been using a strategy called \"The 2 Santa Strategy\" that was developed and actually put into practice during Reagan's presidency (right around when the wealth gap began and continues to explode, funny that). The \"2 Santa Strategy,\" which you can fact check me if you would like, involves recklessly spending and instituting financial policies that will offer short term boosts to economic performance in exchange for massively inflating the debt and causing long term economic harm. Then when they are no longer in power, they relentlessly point out the economic damage and blame it on the left. \n\nThere's also the \"Starve the Beast,\" Strategy that goes hand in hand with the previously mentioned. This plan revolves around intentional sabotage of government programs or departments until they are completely ineffective, then once they have gutted it to a nonfunctional shadow of its intended purpose, they can cry about how poorly these things are handled and cut it's funding for their own gain, either through the privatization of these programs or just completely erasing them to make room for new tax cuts, which oddly always benefit the rich more than the poor. \n\nImmigration: Trump got up on stage one day and started completely making shit up about immigrants, saying counties were just emptying their prisons across our border, throwing a wave of rapists and killers at us, but that's complete bullshit you guys gobbled right up. Not only do immigrants perform crimes at a lower rate than natural born US citizens, but they are essential for the continued functioning of our economy. They not only provide massive amounts of labor that US citizens do not want to do, but they pay into things like Social Security and Medicare without ever pulling any benefits from those programs for themselves. And if you want to point out that they are undercutting the wages of US citizens, who's fault is that really? I know you are smart enough to figure out that they aren't in charge of their own wages, it's big companies that are more than happy to shaft their employees and pay poverty wages to these people seeking a better life. That issue is 100% domestically grown.\n\nI could go on and point out more things that are just objective reality right wingers don't like to hear because it doesn't agree with their feeling but I know most people have already stopped reading. Just remember that if you are always right, that only means you aren't accepting when you're wrong.\n\n(Also PS I think the democratic party has plenty of issues as well, I'm more talking about general ideological principles they represent.

So it felt weird when Pentecost described his drift in an almost Guru like fashion before he was about to enter with Chuck. Because it felt it me that Hercules was actually the one who had more mental strength and had already made peace with the mental obstacles that Pentecost was struggling with. \n\nTo me it would have made a lot more sense if Pentecost was training Mako in drifting with but then passed away of his cancer early in the movie leaving Hercules to take over the operation. Hercules is then hesitant to allow Mako to enter the drift with Raleigh because he knows what will happen when her very fresh grief merges with Raleigh's memories of Yancy experiencing death. \n\nThe whole thing about Pentecost and Mako's relationship was really unnecessary and could have been done better. \n\nBut otherwise the movie was perfect ", "id": 768, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hmws49/pacific_rim_was_one_of_the_best_movies_of_all/", "time": "2024-07-25"}

{"title": "Call of duty: modern warfare 2 (2022) was a good game", "article": "like the title says. I really enjoyed modern warfare 2, and I think that it was actually really good, and I will provide a couple reasons as to why\n\n1. Campaign - I thought the campaign's story was alright, but I really liked how it played out. the mission \"alone\" was one of my favorites, honestly. Recon by fire is a close second. the way they implemented the sniping, and made it so you can get a different angle to get 2 kills at once was in my opinion really good. Then we have the mission dark waters (oil rig), which i thoroughly enjoyed due to how the cqb plays out (no run-and-gun, more slower paced and methodical). and then the final mission which I thought was also pretty neat. In my opinion, it could've been better, but it was something a bit different, as you had an objective to complete while trying to hide and fight back against hassan.\n\n2. Multiplayer - easily one of the best multiplayers of the last few cods (yes, i understand OG cod is really good, but i'm talking about MW2019 and onward). the maps were alright, but I think the gunplay is what I really enjoyed (will get into it in the next point) the gamemodes were amazing. we had a co-op gamemode AND DMZ. the coop was something new, and I think honestly there should be more like it in the newer cods, as I enjoyed playing through it. being able to play as a team in a non-sweaty setting was very fun. DMZ was also something new. a softcore extraction shooter. it was something that they should've kept updating. being able to unlock weapons through DMZ gave you extra incentive to play. Not only that but it being a good way to level up your guns, as well as it just being fun in general through the side quests in the game, and the missions you take before you go in, made it really fun. it was completely different, something that no other COD had, which gave you another reason to buy the game, other than FOMO (fear of missing out).\n\n3. Gunplay - slower movement paired with lower TTK (time to kill) made the game less sweaty. people complained about campers, but I think a bigger problem with newer cods is these movement demons. it makes the game unplayable if people with no job have mastered the ability of running around you at light speed and using a finisher on you. the gunplay in this game made the possibility of that happening very unlikely. The game was also pretty beginner friendly (in my opinion atleast), because there wasn't too much of a learning curve, meaning that new players could get into the game and not die 80 times the instant they load into their first multiplayer game. the focus on realism, too, made it more fun. it wasn't a hyper-realistic tactical shooter, but it was a significant improvement than what came before (vanguard and coldwar- although, i did like coldwar's gunplay, it felt a little bit too arcade-like for me). although COD is an arcade shooter, it brought in a little bit of realism and made it into something new. it was something a little bit more serious in the era of nicki minaj and snoop dogg running around (which honestly i think people over-reacted at). the guns feel amazing to shoot, and the gunsmith, while complicated, was still (in my opinion) somewhat fair, while also being pretty detailed. an un-upgraded gun was still pretty usable, the upgrades (as the name suggests), made them better, but didn't transform them into a completely different gun (atleast from what i've seen). \n\n  \nTL;DR, MW2022 was a good game due to the campaign adding more unique missions, the multiplayer giving us new gamemodes, and the gunplay being less sweaty\n\n", "id": 779, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hmnzbj/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_2_2022_was_a_good_game/", "time": "2025-05-02"}

I'll put it this way; yes, I have seen the many advantages of working remotely, particularly for people with kids, but I think that for the average early-career professional, working 5 days a week in the office is better. In fact, I think that working fully remote in your early career is probably a career killer, to some degree. You simply don't maintain the same types of relationships when you work remotely.

This is why the % of women with the inability to have orgasms with intercourse is so low. It’s not because women are broken or flawed, it’s because guys suck at pleasing women. This is why watching porn is such a turn on for men and not so much for women. Because it’s fake. They’re paid actresses. They must do what sells. Which is women screaming and moaning in ecstasy while being fucked by “experienced men”. BULLSHIT! All women are 100% capable of having fantastic mind-blowing full body orgasms…by themselves. It’s only during sex the issue with climax arises. Sure, we can orgasm with sex, with much effort and concentration. But the big O is peanuts compared to solo sex with self. No matter what craziness your TV/computer/phone screen says. It’s all fantasy. And fantasy is ALWAYS better than reality. Sex included. (Most people fantasize about someone else, while having sex. Admit it 😊)  With solo sex, there’s no rush to climax, no guilt for fantasizing, no painful and uncomfortable contortions to perform at men’s ridiculous porn inspired requests, no mess to clean up or gross expectations, no spitting for lubrication, no worry about being compared to men’s brainwashed ideals of how a real woman’s body should look, no putting up with loud snoring as you lay there finishing what they couldn’t, no endless dirty talk and ego stroking, no listening to fake apologies for blowing it too soon. Yes, sex is overrated. Sex, just like anything else take practice. Most men don’t get enough practice, especially in todays digitally obsessed platform.  And those who do get lots of sex, are so clueless to what turns women on.  This is because most men learn from porn or locker room talk, and a woman can spot these types easily. You’re wasting your time trying to educate these egotistical mind fucks. Your best to shut up and scream hallelujah when it’s over, because they truly believe they are gods gift to women and if they can’t make a woman scream like they see on their screens, then be prepared for a major man-child meltdown.
